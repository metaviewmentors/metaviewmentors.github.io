                        Thank you for the thoughtful questions you asked in your exit cards. 
                        We have copied many below and provide some short answers to the ones we could. 
                        We may need to return some questions after training is complete. <br/>&nbsp;

                <h2>Questions from the Aspire group</h2>
                <h3>Mentor Preparation</h3>
                <h5>Session 1 exit card questions</h5>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">How would I go about considering social identities?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">One of the <a href="self-guided.html">Self-Guided activities</a> 
                    is the <a href="self-guided.html#identity">Social Identity Wheel</a>. 
                    Please complete this activity. There will be opportunities to discuss our 
                    social identities with other Aspire mentors (beyond the training sessions) 
                    as you approach the launch of the program.
                </p>
                <h4 class="collapsible">How do I share stories with my mentees without accidentally 
                    causing harm due to unintended impact?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is an excellent question. We can never know how our words affect others. We can do a few things. First we can undergo training which helps alert us to things we may not have considered before, such as stories being deflating to others. We can also read about and come to appreciate how others have experienced tech classrooms especially those whose experiences are different from ours. Finally we can bounce our stories off of our co-mentor or people we trust to give us a candid, constructive response. It’s so important to be open to continually learning as a mentor.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible"> I was left with a feeling that I am perhaps a bit out of the water for this stuff, I don't feel very confident about being a mentor, but I'm hoping that the upcoming sessions will help with that feeling some more.</h4>
                <p style="display:none">It’s perfectly natural to come away realizing you may have more to learn as a mentor. By coming to training and fully engaging we anticipate your comfort level will improve. There is plenty of time between the end of training and the launch of the program. This is intentional. First, the program organizers need time to place mentors with campuses. Second, we need to provide you with time to look at the materials to prepare. If at that point you feel you need an additional conversation, we are working on what kinds of supports will be available to Aspire mentors in the pilot. We will share this with you when we have it organized.
                </p>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible"> I was left wondering about what was meant by "mentor stories/videos" in terms of whether we would have to do recorded videos or whether that was just nomenclature for what we would share with mentees?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Just to clarify, you will not be recording your own videos. You will share the videos we have prepared with students, and you will share your own stories that are relevant to that topic and to the students.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Is it a good idea to recommend motivational books to mentees that have really helped my personal growth?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Sure, absolutely. You can always say something like, “This book helped me and that’s why I am sharing it. No worries if it does not interest you.”
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">I'm still not sure what is expected from me from the self-guided activities.</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We expect you to complete the <a href="self-guided.html">self-guided work</a> so you come ready to engage with the subsequent training sessions. Doing some of this work on your own will help us to use our session time wisely for what is best done in the group setting. Everyone will have a different level of familiarity with some of the topics, including social identities, and we want to provide space for individuals to explore this as their own pace.
                </p>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">As a mentor, how can I show mentees there is a place for everyone in tech when my experience is only a specific, particular background which they may or may not relate to?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is really thoughtful. We encourage a co-mentor model in part so they can hear more than one perspective. We believe that students can connect through shared experiences (through self-efficacy, mindset, self-regulation, emotional intelligence, feedback and so on), even though people’s backgrounds are different. That said you are just one mentor out of a larger network to which each student has access. You can help them think about who else they might connect to aside from you to complement your perspective.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">What are some strategies that can be used to overcome the negative feelings that come with low self-efficacy?  In other words, how do people build self-efficacy when it's initially low.
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We will talk more about that in Session 2, when we focus on your role as a mentor to help students build their self-efficacy. You can help by encouraging them to achieve small successes, and build upon them. Self-efficacy grows through high-quality feedback and by observing others.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Session 2 exit card questions</h5>
                
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">I wanted more context/guidance on how to respond to students asking me to put their resume through (this came up on one of the polls).</h4>
                <p style="display:none">You are signing up as a mentor to help introductory students to advance in their tech journey. IIf a student asks you to review their resume, and you have time and want to, you can agree. If you do not wish to or do not have time, you can say, “Unfortunately that is out the scope of what I am able to do in this program. When the program ends, we could revisit this.” Or “Although I cannot help you with that, do you have someone at the campus career center who could help you? I’d be happy to brainstorm with you so you can get another set of eyes on that resume.” <br/><br/>

If someone asks you to put in their resume into the system, you can be perfectly candid and say “legally, anyone – even someone close to me must apply online. I encourage you to go to the careers website and submit your resume for an internship.”  
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">In the case of the student crying and wondering if they should drop the class - encouragement is great, but there's also cases where maybe it is in their best interest to make the tough decision to drop the class. How would you go about handling something like that, where you want to make sure they don't feel discouraged, but also that they make the best decision for themselves?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a great question. We hope that as mentors you always put it back to the student to make their own decision. Even if you think, by initially listening, the student may be better served by dropping the class, we want you to pause a minute and consider the following. Many introductory students, especially students from underrepresented groups, are encouraged to drop when they do poorly or seem lost, or when they do not appear to be a “fit” for the field. It’s of course possible that dropping is a good decision, but we hope to make sure a student first feels they can be successful before they make that decision. When someone is learning a new area of study, it is common to feel lost and make mistakes. This is part of growing. If after they persist they decide to choose a different path, we hope that mentors will have been part of a process that led them to figure out how they could keep going if they wanted to do so.                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">How would I handle a question I don't have the answer to?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We would encourage you to be honest that you do not know the answer, and think together with the student on where you might both go about finding the answer. Think about the self-regulated learning cycle we saw in Session 2, where we plan, do and evaluate. You can act as a mirror to help the student reflect on how to be strategic. You could ask your co-mentor, you could offer to bring it back to the broader mentoring team, and you could encourage the student seek the answer from another person at the campus (e.g., their professors or advisors, an upper-level student in the CS club, the alumni association if relevant for another industry professional).                </p>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">It was mentioned that some issues would not be able to be kept confidential. I'm still unsure what these issues are and what the correct way to handle them is.
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Thank you for this question. We will provide a guidance document that helps mentors and mentees to know what is allowed to stay confidential. In short, mentors are unable to keep conversations confidential that include when mentees threaten to harm someone else or themselves, disclose sexual assault, or share that they have observed faculty, staff, or students who may be putting others in danger (e.g., faculty who are showing up under the influence of drugs or alcohol in class). Specific examples such as these will be provided so that everyone understands that if these are disclosed you would need to elevate or report this to your Microsoft mentoring program contact. You might say: “Thank you so much for sharing that with me. This is something that rises above what I am permitted to keep confidential. I will need to share this with my Microsoft mentoring program contact. Within my role, what can I do to help you to move forward from here?”<br/><br/>

Mentors may encounter situations where mentees share difficult circumstances such as experiencing a toxic team in a class or a professor who is rude, but not physically dangerous. In these circumstances, you can elect to ask, privately to the student who shares the information, if it is ok with them if you pass along the information, without using their name, the concerns you are hearing to the Microsoft mentoring contact. In this way, the Microsoft mentoring contact can follow up with campus partners to share, in aggregate, some concerns we are hearing with the hopes that this will help them to improve the situation for students on their campus.
                </p>

                <h5>Session 3 exit card questions</h5>
                <h4 class="collapsible">Suppose I can see a mentee going in a direction of saying something that can make some other set of mentees feel less included. How can I correct the situation?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This was the situation we discussed during the breakout in Session 3, when the student wanted to talk more about IDE/cloud computing, and the conversation turned to all jargon. Where possible, try to lift up a level and talk about the process of approaching the topic, instead of the topic itself. If you can bring the whole group into the conversation, please do. If not and you want to (and have the time!), you could offer to connect with the student on that topic at the end of the call, or at a separate time. 
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">There were a couple of times when we talked about the value of having 1:1 conversations with students afterwards/offline; what's the best/recommended way to initiate/invite/schedule that?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a great question. If there is an easy way to bring the question to the whole group, please do so. But if it really seems specific to the student, you can take a few actions. If your time is tight, you can offer to stay on the call at the end for a few minutes or say you will follow-up on email. If you prefer, or if those methods do not resolve things, you can table it or postpone the conversation till your closing 1:1.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">How vulnerable some students will feel comfortable becoming, and how that will affect other students who may not feel as comfortable.  We want it to feel like a safe space, but we also don't want to pressure people to share if they're not ready.
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Absolutely. As mentors you can encourage students to only share what they are comfortable sharing. No one should be pressured into telling a particular story or one that is especially emotional. This is a tech-focused mentoring program so our hope is that people will share stories that by and large pertain to their tech journey. The opening video and introductory session will set some of these boundaries. We have modeled some scenarios where someone might share a personal story, because for many students, pursuing tech may get emotional and personal. 
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">What to do if someone is snarky/sarcastic/on their phone?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We discussed this a little bit. With the snarky and sarcastic, we hope you might find a way to ask a question. For example, “I’m confused. Could you say more about why you didn’t care about that?” Or, “I am unsure where you were going with this. I feel like I am missing something.” You can also ask to connect with that student 1:1 and review the intent vs. impact. You can say, “I hope you had a different intention with your comment, but the impact for me was I felt the program was not being valued by you. How can I help support your participation? I’d like to see your contribution to this group. It’s more difficult if you make comments that make it seem you don’t take it seriously.” A similar conversation could be had with a student distracted by their phone. It might help to “press reset” for the group. For example, if you say, “Hey everyone, let’s just take a quick moment to check into the space. Let’s review our ground rules. I really want to respect everyone’s time that they are investing. I know it can be hard if you have something on your mind, and at the same time, I need everyone present to make this worthwhile.”
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">I would like to have more explanation about the art gallery activity of the second session, I don't think it was very clear how I should explain that to the mentees.</h4>
                <p style="display:none">You will be provided a mentor toolkit with information including resources to use to guide you. After you have reviewed this, we think the challenge will make more sense.
                </p>

                <h3>Logistics and Program Information</h3>
                <h5>Session 1 exit card questions</h5>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">Will there be faculty present at the mentoring sessions?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">There will be no faculty present at the Aspire mentoring sessions. We are providing the training workshops. Only you, your co-mentor, and the students who have signed up will be participating.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">How will we be connected with mentees? Will we get student / mentee demographic information? Curious to know who my students will be (what programming language or from what school)?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We will share more information as we grow closer to September. After the training is
complete, the program coordinators will know how many mentors are available to be matched. When you are matched, we will provide you with information about the campus and when available, the information we can provide about your mentees.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">More on the role of Learn Ambassador and how they play into the program our role in it.
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a good question. There is no planned connection between the Learn Ambassadors and the Aspire group in this program. We are training together right now because both groups will be running this mentoring program.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible"> How will we be assigned a co-mentor, what will the format of the mentorship be (times + dates, will we schedule on our own time?)
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We will be looking at a variety of factors, including if you have a preference for a co-mentor and your time zone. We encourage co-mentors who can complement one another, whether their role at Microsoft, their own CS journey, their social identities, and their comfort with various aspects of the program. We will do our best to match mentors who want to serve. You will be signing up for a 7 week commitment to run this fall, between mid-late September and mid-November. You will have some flexibility to set the weekly time/day for your mentoring program and students will sign up knowing that is when it will be running. This means the program could run in the evening or weekend, if that suited you, and we will want to avoid times that will conflict with when the introductory CS students are in class.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">What is the plan for the next few weeks/months? It seems like there will be time between the training ending and school starting - what happens during that time?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">As mentioned, the program coordinators will be working on connecting to the campuses to create a match based on the number of mentors we have available.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Will I get a chance to socialize with other Aspires I met during this session? Am interested in getting a chance to meet others at Microsoft who are participating in this program and have my similar interests?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a great suggestion. We will look for ways to make this happen
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">I am curious about how different the college campuses will be.  I come from a highly competitive program which recently made a change to primarily direct-admit program (straight from high school), and I imagine this is a very different dynamic from college campuses where CS is an open major. </h4>
                <p style="display:none">For this pilot, we anticipate a range of US college campuses, to include campuses that are situated within underserved communities as well as minority-serving institutions. There are students on every single college campus who are interested in CS and in mentoring, but for the pilot, we will only be able to partner with a small number as we learn together.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Will the actual mentoring session be very prescriptive, or do I have the option of re-structuring it?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a structured mentoring program. Each session has room for you to bring your voice and your stories. There is always 30 minutes of open time for conversation, following the structured exercises. For the pilot we ask that you follow the mentoring curriculum that is provided.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">In what particular ways would we be mentoring others? What is the scope of this program?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We showed you that the program involves 7 weeks. The first week involves planning with your co-mentor. In week 2 you will engage in an intro session with the group and also connect in short one-on-one meetings with mentees. Then you will engage in four group sessions that follow a “Tech Resilience” curriculum, and so you will have a mentoring curriculum to guide you. These topics include recognizing and engaging discomfort, being strategic, and pivoting. You will use the videos as conversation starters. You will also facilitate students through a set of tech challenges that will engage their problem solving skills. Importantly you will promote a sense of belonging among your mentees and encourage them to persist.
                </p>

                <h5>Session 2 exit card questions</h5>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">Will we have the same co-mentor for the cohort sessions? Will the co-mentors have debrief/planning sessions prior to going into the meetings with the cohort?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Yes you will remain with the same co-mentor for the duration of the program. The fall pilot is a 7 week program structure, where the first week is a planning week with your co-mentor to decide how to tag-team or divide up the different components based on your own comfort and interest; you may also decide on touching base before each group session.                 </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Will we have instructions for our actual sessions with our mentors?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We will provide you with a mentor toolkit with session-by-session guidance. We expect this to be ready in mid to late August. 
                </p>

                <h5>Session 3 exit card questions</h5>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">What will be the breakdown of 1:1s vs group discussions with mentees?</h4>
                <div style="display:none"><p>In the Fall pilot, you will have a group welcome/intro session, followed by an opening 1:1 meeting (15 minutes) each with mentee in your circle (4-6 students), which will happen in the same week as your intro session. Then you will have 4 group “content” sessions (with videos, a CS challenge, and open discussion) before a closing 1:1 meeting (20 minutes) with each mentee. Here is an overview of the 7 program weeks:
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Before the mentoring sessions start, you will have a planning session with your co-mentor.
<li>Week 2: A (shorter) opening group session, followed by opening 15-minute 1:1s scheduled with each mentee individually (scheduled at your mutual convenience).
<li>Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6: Group “content” sessions (with video, CS challenge, second video and open discussion), 2 hours each.
<li>Week 7: Closing 20-minute 1:1s with each mentee individually (scheduled at your mutual convenience)
</ul>
                </p></div>

                <h4 class="collapsible">We've seen the sessions work with 1 mentor, how do these dynamics change with another mentor in the room? Will we both be synthesizing and summarizing the feedback during the open discussion time?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Such a great question! We will be discussing this more in Session 4. In each group session, you and your co-mentor will decide in advance who wants to lead the opening video and story share (as well as the report back from pairs), and who wants to lead the closing video and story share (plus the round robin and synthesis). You will also talk about who wants to lead the CS challenge. You’ll tag team the session. A co-mentor can always chime in after one mentor does their synthesis. Both mentors will actively participate in the unstructured open conversation in each group session. We’ll also provide recommendations in the toolkit.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">How many students are in the groups? What frequency are the sessions scheduled at?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">For the Fall Pilot, we are anticipating 8-12 mentees in the entire group, so each co-mentor will have 4-6 mentees assigned to them. The sessions run for 2 hours per week, for 6 weeks. We ask you to hold 7 weeks for the program, so you have one week to review your plans with your co-mentor.
                </p>

                <h5>Session 1 exit card questions</h5>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">I need some clarity on what you mean by social identities and how they will impact the mentoring process.</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is the focus of the second <a href="self-guided.html">Self-Guided activity</a>. The  <a href="self-guided.html#identity">Social Identity Wheel</a> activity will help you to think about how you see yourself, and how you see others. Our experiences are not always visible to others. This activity will help you to think about what may make it more challenging for you to initially connect to your mentees, and the mentees to you. Learning more about social identities is an important part of being an effective mentor.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Intent vs. Impact - I would love some more clarity on this.
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">The idea of intent vs impact is incredibly important in mentoring and in communication generally. Sometimes we speak with a certain intent or goal in mind. However, what we intend may not match what is heard - it may land with some negative consequences. If that listener shares that to you, it is important to acknowledge and process, not jump to defending your intention; instead, hear the impact. An effective mentor owns the responsibility to continue to work on communication.
                </p>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">Will we get access to all of the videos?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a pilot program, and we are currently editing the videos to be ready for the launch of the program. We have provided access to the videos you need to prepare for the self-guided work, and the rest are being shown during the training. Please do not share these publicly; they are only for this pilot training group. When we have all of the finalized materials, we will share them with you in advance of your program launch.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">The last scenario activity (of Session 1). 
                    We wondered what actually we needed to do?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Scenarios are a starting point to discuss and reflect on how you will engage as a mentor. The scenarios we provided were intended to prompt you to think about how the mentors were crafting their stories. In the first scenario, the person had not struggled with technology before, so they did not feel they could authentically share that as part of their story. We heard groups brainstorming about how the mentor was struggling to empathize, and how they could view that struggle in a way that connected to the topic at hand. They could also think about another area (outside of CS), as our facilitator shared (in public speaking), where they did feel a sense of struggle before success. It might also be a good time for this mentor to hand off the storytelling to their co-mentor.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Session 2 exit card questions</h5>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Can we mentor students for AI, ML cybersecurity etc. or is it just for programming?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We are launching this fall a pilot program that is designed specifically for introductory CS students who are taking programming courses. In the future, this can be expanded to include other students. If your campus does not have introductory CS courses, please ask the Microsoft Coordinators for Learn Ambassadors about which courses from which it will make sense to recruit.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Aside from not giving students assignment answers, what are ways mentors should avoid crossing boundaries? What specific boundaries do we have as mentors?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a great question. We encourage you to see yourself in three primary roles: a facilitator of the mentoring sessions, a coach as new CS students are figuring things out, and a role model who is willing to share their experience. If you want to look at a student’s homework, with the goal of helping that student think through what they have tried and where they are stuck, of course you can. However, we know in the longer run, if that student can make use of the existing faculty and TA and study group structures, that is a more sustainable plan.<br/><br/>
 
As a current student you may need to be cognizant of what it looks like to maintain professional boundaries if you have a friend in the mentoring group. This may mean having a direct conversation with your friend prior to the program starting so they understand that you are in a leadership role, and while you are in the mentoring space, you will not be providing that person with extra attention, sharing inside jokes, or anything else that will detract from a strong group dynamic. This also means that mentors do not ask mentees to connect for social reasons. We will outline this in a document that will be advised by the Microsoft Coordinators for Learn Ambassadors.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Could we hear more about mental health and supporting people under duress?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">We will be providing a document that makes clear what you can and cannot keep confidential. This includes a mentee sharing a threat of harm to themselves or others. If you are concerned about a student, you can express that concern privately to them. “I noticed you were under stress today in the session. As a mentor, please let me know if I can brainstorm with you about where you could get additional support.” If a mentee asks for help that is outside of your role, you can also say: “I want to see you get additional support. This is really outside of my own comfort zone, and honestly it is outside my mentoring role. With your permission, I’d like to ask my Microsoft program contact for some advice so we can get you access to some additional help.” 
                </p>

                <h5>Session 3 exit card questions</h5>

                <h4 class="collapsible">What does a mentor do when one of the mentees becomes verbally aggressive and refuses to take corrections?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Consider asking to speak to the mentee after the group session. Ask them to help you to understand. For example, “I’d like to include you in the program. Your behavior is not following our ground rules and we can’t have verbal aggression in the session. Is something going on?” We strongly encourage you to reach out to your Learn Ambassador contacts at Microsoft if something like this happens so you can gain support.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">When it comes to responding in front of total group, I feel I forget what I discussed in the last break out.</h4>
                <p style="display:none">You are in mentor training, and this is a new skill. We have been teaching and mentoring for a long time. Please know that no one expects you to remember everything everyone said! If you want to write things down, you can do that, and remember your co-mentor could pick up where you left off. You can even pause after 2 people have spoken and notice what you heard across both of them, before moving on. There is no one right way to do this. We are offering some modeling of a particular strategy that can save time in the session and help each person to feel heard. What’s important is that you do not just notice and respond to one person’s story and not another. We are encouraging you to be mindful of this as you encourage voices to enter into the space. Your goal is to keep the conversation going as best as you can.

                <h3>Logistics and Program Information</h3>
                <h5>Session 1 exit card questions</h5>
                
                <h4 class="collapsible">Will we get to choose who we mentor with? Do we get to mentor with other Aspires if we are Learn ambassadors? When will we meet our co-mentors?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a great question. The Microsoft Coordinators for Learn Ambassadors will weigh in on the specific logistics after training is complete. For the Fall pilot, we anticipate that you will mentor with another student who has completed training. Learn Ambassadors will not co-mentor with Aspires. Aspires will co-mentor with other Aspires.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Is it possible to have mentees from other colleges?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Again, the Microsoft Coordinators for Learn Ambassadors will weigh in on the specific logistics after training is complete. For the Fall pilot, we anticipate that you will mentor intro CS students from your same home campus. If your co-mentor is at a different institution, your cohort may have students from 2 different schools.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">If I want to participate as a mentee to one of the Aspire mentors, how do I go about that?</h4>
                <p style="display:none">You may not be able to arrange this for the Fall pilot. The Microsoft Coordinator for the Aspire Fall Pilot will be arranging the pilot with a small set of campuses. If your campus is selected, you would need to be an introductory CS student to participate. However, we hope the program will expand in future semesters.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Will the mentor and co-mentor meet with all mentees every session or could we have separate meetings mainly and meet with the entire cohort for less time?
</h4>
                <p style="display:none">This is a pilot program with a specific structure to help us learn what is effective. Each mentor will have a set of mentees (a small group, let’s say 4-6 people) that they meet with one-on-one in the first week and again at the end of the program. You and your co-mentor run all of the group sessions <em>together</em>. 
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">I was a little late to join in and may have missed the beginning half hour and wasn't able to get in a group, so I was confused. </h4>
                <p style="display:none">Mentorship is a commitment, and the training sessions are something we take very seriously. If you do not attend the training sessions in their entirety and complete the self-guided work, you may not participate in the Fall Pilot.
                </p>

                <h4 class="collapsible">Will we have a reference toolkit for later on? That would help us a lot.</h4>
                <p style="display:none">Yes, you will have a mentor toolkit with session-by-session guidance. We expect this to be ready in mid to late August.
