                        We expect that some of you may want more than what is provided during this training, whether structured or self-guided. We look forward to hearing your feedback and requests, and we plan to offer some recommended resources for further learning, especially as you get closer to your program launch date. As part of the inaugural pilot mentor group, we thank you in advance for co-constructing this training process with us!<br/>&nbsp;

                <h2>Self-Guided Activity #1: Crafting a story for mindset</h2>
                <p><ul>                
                <li>Watch a video which covers mindset.
                <li>Draft a relevant story for this video that you could use as a lead-in. 
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong> As discussed in Session 1, you will be leading reflection around 
                    short videos with your mentoring cohort. To open the space, you will share a short story 
                    (2-3 minutes) in advance of showing the video. </p>

                <p><strong>When?</strong> After Session 1 and before Session 4 (July 24). <br/>
<em>                During Session 4, you’ll have the chance to practice facilitating a video and shareout. Therefore, we recommend completing this activity in advance; you probably want to work on it soon after our first session, which is centered on crafting mentoring stories.</em>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/s-KaUy16pDw" target="_blank">“Is it possible for me to do this?”</a> video on mindset.
                    <li>Reflect upon the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In which areas do you feel you have a fixed mindset or growth mindset?
                            <ul>
                                <li>About yourself as a learner or person?
                                <li>About who can learn computer science?
                                <li>About your own capacity as a mentor?
                            </ul>
                            <li>Has your mindset ever changed? When?
                        </ul>
                <blockquote>It’s important to reflect on this for yourself as a person/learner and also as you think about your role as a mentor. For example, you might review some of the curriculum and have a reaction that one component would be better for your co-mentor to lead, or another part that you are more well-suited for. While it is important to listen to these reactions, you can also pause and ask: is this an opportunity for me to stretch and grow as a mentor? Later, when training is complete and you engage in the preparation for the program launch with your co-mentor, we hope you can talk openly to each other about your comfort and discomfort with various parts of the mentoring program. </blockquote>

                <blockquote>Similarly, when you meet your mentees, you may also have an immediate impression about who is “bright” and who is a “people person” and who is “going places.” Remember that we cannot always see into a student’s future upon a first meeting. A growth mindset is so important for mentors; we need to stay open to who our mentees may become before our very eyes.</blockquote>

                <li>Draft a mentoring story that can help learners appreciate the limits of a fixed mindset or the power of a growth mindset. It is not essential to write a full script and it is actually better to jot down the key points you want to make. That way, you can remember the story you want to share without memorizing it. You are not committing to using this particular story when you are leading your mentoring program. However, you will use this for Session 4 when we practice facilitation and it will help if you have already selected a story to share. You should aim for a story that can be told in 2-3 minutes. 
	
                <p>Remember:
                <ul>
                    <li>A superstar story is less attainable. It’s great to include a successful outcome, but a student will connect more to your story if you can share how you struggled before succeeding, or what you grappled with before persisting.
                    <li>Mindset is about how we sometimes limit ourselves to certain things that we think we are already good at, and maybe we think we were born to do certain things. This might involve how we compare ourselves to other people, whether fairly or not. It could involve how we wanted to look smart or successful, and maybe avoided certain things (like asking for help) as a result. Maybe it is about a time where we stretched ourselves to try something new.
                    <li>It might help to start with this prompt: “I used to think: _____ (about myself). Then, this happened (tell the story). And now I think: ___________ (about myself).”
                    <li>There is no one perfect story. Being authentic is important. You will have time before the program launch to talk about your stories with your co-mentor.

                <p><strong>Why?</strong> Mentors and mentees may be more or less familiar with identity terminology, so we offer a glossary of some identity terms so you have access to a shared language. By subsequenting reflecting on your own social identities, both those that are important to you and those which your students may see you as having (whether or not they are important to you), we believe you will be more prepared to navigate conversations that will come up the training and mentoring sessions.</p>

                <h2>Self-Guided Activity #3: Intergroup dynamics
</h2>
                <p><ul>                
                <li>Examine the assumptions you might make when meeting others.
                <li>Reflect on how assumptions can impact intergroup dynamics.
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong> Being an effective mentor means that we may have to challenge assumptions about students, particularly those we make upon an initial meeting. We have a responsibility to construct a mentoring space where students can see that others believe in their potential. If we conclude that a student’s behavior means “they are not cut out for this,” then we shortchanging the mentoring for them. We hold implicit bias that we bring with us to interactions with people, and we have to actively work against that.  </p>

<p>As human beings, we automatically place people into categories (e.g., peer vs stranger) and make judgements when meeting people and trying to make sense of behavior (e.g., this person is confused vs “gets it”). However, this automatic process can be flawed, as we tend to criticize others differently than we would judge ourselves or a good friend. If someone is late or appears distracted, we might internally think, “they don’t care” or “they are unmotivated” instead of assuming they are having a bad day. Researchers call this a <em>fundamental attribution error</em>: when we attribute or explain another person’s behavior in a negative and sometimes untrue manner during this automatic decision-making process. </p>

                <p><strong>When?</strong> Before Session 3 (July 21). <br/>
<em>You may find this work useful in advance of Session 3 (July 21), which will focus on how to optimize your mentoring space. We will touch on a variety of terms, including microaggressions, active bystander, and interrupting a negative dynamic.</em>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                <li>Read this <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/01/microaggressions" target="_blank">short piece</a> about microaggressions and how to respond when you are the a) target, b) bystander, or c) microaggressor.  
                <li>Read these two short resources about strategies one can use to interrupt or respond to a microaggression.

                    </ol>
                <li>Reflect on what you’ve read with the following prompts: 
                    <ul>
                    <li>Were you familiar with this terminology before? 
                    <li>Have you experienced a microaggression as a student or at work? Have you observed one as a bystander? Where on the continuum did you fall?
                    <li>Looking back, can you think of an experience where you might have engaged in 
                        one of these behaviors as a microaggressor? 
                    <li>Thinking about the mentoring program, what if a student says something 
                        that is a microaggression. Do you think you would notice it? What action would you take (perhaps considering the Ally Action Continuum)?
                    </ul>
                <li>Read the descriptions for each of the following hypothetical students. 
                    <blockquote><u>Student A</u>: When you first meet with them, they express anxieties about 
                            taking Computer Science and are clearly concerned that they will be in over 
                            their heads. They mention that they are an Art History major and 
                            have no experience with programming.<br/></blockquote>
                    <blockquote><u>Student B</u>: When you first meet him, he starts telling you about some 
                            of his favorite programming projects in high school. He makes a point of 
                            dropping a few technical terms and expressing enthusiasm about studying computer science.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote><u>Student C</u>: When you first meet her, she is effusive and scattered. She 
                            tells you that she is a non-traditional age student and that she hasn't taken a 
                            Math class in over 30 years. She says her kids have convinced her that she needs 
                            to get more familiar with computers. She doesn't seem at all anxious about the class.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote><u>Student D</u>: When you first meet this student, they appear annoyed about the 
                            CS challenges that will be discussed in this program and does not appear to take them 
                            seriously. When you bring this up with them individually, the student makes it clear 
                            that they do not feel like CS is hard, they finish their work much faster than their 
                            classmates and they don’t think they need this program.</blockquote>
                    For each student, write the assumptions you find yourself making about that student as a person, 
                    as a student in general, and how that student will perform in their introductory CS class. 

                    Then reflect on: how could you challenge this assumption? 
                        <ul>
                        <li>Ask an open-ended question to gather more information. 
                        <li>Invite the student to participate in an activity that could help, based on what you hear.
                        <li>How could you learn more about students’ different lived experiences so you can have a 
                            fuller perspective on stereotypes and bias that may be affecting them every day?
                        </ul>

<em>Session 2 (July 17) will cover the CS Challenge components of the mentoring sessions, so there will be more context given for the first scenario. During the final July 24 session, you’ll have the chance to practice facilitating different components of the mentoring sessions.

                <li>Reflect back: When your cohort shares their experiences, you mirror or restate in your own words what you heard. 
                <li>Synthesize across the group: Highlight themes/commonalities (“it is interesting that all of you found this component of the lesson to be so valuable.”) or contrasts/differences (“I noticed that this really resonated with some of you, while others of you felt less connected to it.”) 
                <li>Rather than comment after each person shares (aside from thanking them or clarifying what they said), hear back from the group first. Then reflect back and synthesize what you’ve heard. 
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                Read each of the two sample session scenarios. Practice reflecting back and synthesizing what you heard. You may want to practice saying it out loud or jotting down some notes. 
                <ul>
                <li>After each student shares out, how will you respond? Your response should be brief, maybe 30 seconds to a minute. 
                <li>Once all students have shared, how will you reflect back and synthesize what you heard? You should aim for 1-3 minutes.
                </ul> <br/>
                                
                <strong>Scenario 1: “Spot the Differences” CS Challenge</strong><br/>
                In Session 2 of the mentoring pilot, students will engage in a “Spot the Differences" activity in pairs by looking at short programs written in Python and Java. The goal is for them to recognize and work through discomfort that may arise from looking at code (perhaps in a language they’ve never seen) and working with someone they may have only just met. After they complete the activity, you will call on students to share their experience, one student from each pair. Imagine you have done this, and this is what the students share: 

                <ul>
                <li>Student 1: <em>I already knew Python, and I found it to be really easy.</em></li>
                <li>Student 2: <em>I liked working with my partner. Rather than a race to win, it felt really collaborative.</em></li>
                <li>Student 3: <em>There were enough bugs to find. We could each find some.</em></li>
                <li>Student 4: <em>Doing this activity, I was not familiar with Java and yet I could figure out some things just by looking. This made me feel more confident.</em></li>
            </ul> <br/>

                <strong>Scenario 2: Video share of “Is this for me?”</strong><br/>
                You will share a <a href="https://youtu.be/IQ1SZg2O-aY">video</a> on the topic of Belonging (the sense of being valued and respected in a space) before sharing what resonated with them. Imagine that you have shown the video and engaged in a “round robin” to hear from each student in the group, and this is what the students share.
                <ul>
                <li>Student 1: <em>I remember being in a class in high school where I didn’t want to raise my hand because I didn’t want to look stupid. I wasn’t sure if my teacher in the class believed I was smart or that I could do it. I just felt out of place.</em></li>
                <li>Student 2: <em>I signed up for a robotics challenge over the summer. They ran workshops, and I wasn’t the only newbie. I looked at the person next to me and asked, “Do you know what you are doing?” The person laughed and said, “no.” So I said, “me neither,” and we worked on things together. I really felt connected and comfortable after that.</em></li>
                <li>Student 3: <em>When I started my summer research, I was very nervous. A graduate student working in the lab went out of their way to make me feel welcome. They even asked my opinion on some things, and it made me realize I had something to contribute. That felt good.</em></li>
                <li>Student 4: <em>On campus, I am part of a student organization where I do feel I belong. I walk in and I feel like I can just be myself. But when I walk into my CS class… you know that feeling of looking around and trying to impress people or that you have to fit in? It’s like that for me. I hate that feeling.</em> </li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Bonus Self-Guided Activity: Crafting a story on effective feedback</h2>
                <p><ul>                
                <li>Watch a video which covers effective feedback.
                <li>Draft a relevant story for this video that you could use as a lead-in. 
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong> As discussed in Session 1, you will be leading reflection around 
                    short videos with your mentoring cohort. To open the space, you will share a short story 
                    (2-3 minutes) in advance of showing the video. </p>

                <p><strong>When?</strong> Before Session 4 (July 24). <br/>
<em>                During Session 4, you’ll have the chance to practice facilitating a video and shareout. If you complete this activity in advance, 
    this will give you an alternative to the Self-Guided Activity #1 on mindset.</em>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rkOoS2rfR_w" target="_blank">“Where did that come from?”</a> video on effective feedback.
                    <li>Reflect upon the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can you think of a time when you received feedback that took you aback?
                            <li>Were you able to unpack it? In the moment? Later? 
                            <li>Do you have someone to ask to help you unpack feedback?
                        </ul>
                <blockquote>Feedback can be a tricky part of iterating our plan. Others can help us to improve our work, but we have 
                    to be in the right mindset to receive it and to incorporate it. Of course there might be feedback that we have to 
                    decide to leave on the table. But most of the time, those who are in a position to give us feedback (our professor, 
                    a classmate, a supervisor, a friend) have something constructive to offer. Our challenge is to not let the fear of 
                    receiving feedback or the sting of difficult feedback keep us from improving our work. Indeed, feedback is a key 
                    way to gain more information about which parts of our plan are strong and which could benefit from revision.</blockquote>

                <li>Draft a mentoring story that can help learners take agency over how they give and receive feedback. This is a moment
                    to be vulnerable and highlight how to be strategic in packing and unpacking feedback. It might be a moment to reflect on
                    how to connect feedback to self-regulation and emotional intelligence or how it could impact self-efficacy for a task.<br/><br/>
                
                    Remember, you do not need to write a full script, and it is actually better to jot down the key points you want to make. 
                    That way, you can remember the story you want to share without memorizing it. You are not committing to using this 
                    particular story when you are leading your mentoring program. However, you will use this for Session 4 when we 
                    practice facilitation and it will help if you have already selected a story to share. You should aim for a story 
                    that can be told in 2-3 minutes. 
	
                <p>Remember:
                <ul>
                    <li>Craft a story that is <strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>attainable</strong>.
                    <li>There is no one perfect story. Being authentic is important. You will have time before the program launch 
                        to talk about your stories with your co-mentor.
