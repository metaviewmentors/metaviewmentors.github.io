                    <strong>Restrict chat usage.</strong>
                    Please use the chat for session content only and be respectful that 
                    this is a large meeting.<br/><br/>
                    <strong>Breakout support is limited.</strong>
                    If you lose connectivity during a breakout, understand that we are unable to put 
                    you back into the breakout. As soon as we are able to, we will admit you back to the 
                    main meeting room; please be patient as we work within the constraints of the
                     technology!

                    We are using Zoom for this training, giving us breakout rooms for small group work. To 
                    make the session as smooth as possible, we ask that you:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use a computer.</strong> In Session 2 particularly, you may need to use the screen share functionality to work in your group.
                        <li><strong>Rename yourself</strong> when you join the call. Use your first and last name, whether you are <strong>(A)</strong>spire, a <strong>(L)</strong>earn Ambassador or <strong>(O)</strong>ther, plus your pronouns if you use pronouns and want to be referred using pronouns, as in:
        <ul>
            <li>Mary Smith (A) she/her
            <li>Quinn Hanson (L) they/them
            <li>Corey Jones (O)
        </ul>

        At the bottom menu bar (in black) click on the <em>Participants</em> button, click on <em>rename</em>, update your screen name and click OK.  <br/>

        <li><strong>Stay muted.</strong>
        You should unmute when you speak in the smaller breakout rooms, and if called upon to share during the whole-group sessions. Too much background noise negatively impacts the experience for everyone. We will mute you if need be.

        <li><strong>Use video</strong> when possible. Plan to have your video on for all breakout sessions and much of the whole-group sessions. You can turn it off when we are screen-sharing or if your internet connection is not strong.

        <li><strong>Find Speaker/Gallery View.</strong> In the top right hand corner you will see a small icon that you can use to change from Speaker to Gallery view and back.<br/>

        <li><strong>Open the chat.</strong> This can be found along the bottom menu bar (in black) just to the right of the Share Screen button. You may need to click the More ... button. You can the chat ask a question or make a comment as we go through the session. You can either aim your message at <em>Everyone</em> or <em>privately</em> to a specific participant. Note that private chat messages with a host are visible to all hosts via the transcript after the meeting.

                    					<h4>Ground Rules</h4>
        <strong>Be open-minded.</strong> We may introduce ideas in the training that you are unsure about or have questions about. We ask that you stay open-minded to us and to your fellow mentors.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Be willing to be uncomfortable.</strong> We like to think of mentoring as something that is positive, and it is. Yet being an effective mentor means we may have to be uncomfortable with what we don’t know. It can also mean trying new things, or working with other mentors and with student mentees in ways that push us out of our comfort zone. This is when we learn. It doesn’t mean it is easy.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Speak from your own perspective.</strong> We want you to use “I” statements, which means you speak for yourself and from your own vantage point. It’s easy to say “we at Microsoft” or “we from this university” think or do things in a certain way. But, it helps if you only speak for yourself rather than for other people.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Be patient and allow space for all to learn.</strong> We recognize everyone is at different places in their learning and have had different experiences. For some of you, this may be a review, and you could facilitate training for others. We ask you to be patient and help others move forward. For this pilot to be successful, we will need everyone to be on the same page and at a certain level of comfort. Toward that end, please think about whether you should step up or step back. If you are someone who needs to push yourself and learn more, we encourage you to step up to the challenge. If someone in your group needs you for support, we ask you to step up to this challenge. If you are someone who knows the answer or knows what to do, please step back from time to time so others get a chance to participate.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Facilitation means interruption.</strong> We only have a limited amount of time with you during each structured session. As facilitators, we may need to interrupt your thought process and conversation. Please know we value your contributions, and we do not interrupt for a lack of care for what you have to offer. To respect your time, we will push forward, which can feel challenging. We name this now to flag it going in. Please know you will have opportunities to ask questions or share ideas, whether in the chat, through end-of-session exit cards, after the session and in other spaces.<br/><br/>
        <strong>What’s said here stays here; what’s learned can be shared.</strong> When people are learning, they may make missteps. We all say things that we wish we could revise. We ask that you do not leave the training space and refer back to what specific people said when they were practicing their mentoring. This way we can all relax a bit into learning. We do, however, encourage you to share anything you <i>learn</i>.

        <h4 id="participation">Group Mentoring Sessions: Participation Strategies</h4> 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Group Polls</strong>: Each participant gives an <em>anonymous</em> opinion by clicking on questions on the screen. This allows the group to engage without hand-raising or speaking.
                <li><strong>Pair-Share</strong>: Participants break into pairs where each person shares with a partner about their experience and actively listens to their partner's experience. It is typical for the pairs to come back to the large group and a member of the pair shares out to the larger group. Many who find large groups difficult will participate in a pair-share activity. A pair-share can be done with trios. 
                <li><strong>Round Robin</strong>: This method of participation is typically saved for the end of a structured group session, before moving into open discussion. Each person is called upon to share, and can pass their turn. Some may choose to defer (come back to them), or skip their turn (do not participate). This method helps all voices to be heard.
                    <blockquote>Because we’re in a remote setting, I’m going to just call on you, but you can pass. <br/>
                        X, we’d love to hear from you. Unmute yourself. Can you take a minute or so to tell us what resonated?
                    </blockquote>
                <li><strong>Active listening</strong>: listen to understand
                <li><strong>Reflect</strong> back and <strong>synthesize</strong>: mirror what you heard and highlight common themes or salient differences
                <li><strong>Step up, step back</strong>: be aware of when to take up space, and when to make room for more voices

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Do</strong> clarify (mirror) what you hear: <span class="good-talking">“I’m hearing 
                            you say that… Did I get that right?”</span>
                        <li><strong>Do</strong> appreciate others for sharing: <span class="good-talking">“Thanks so much 
                            for sharing that with me.” </span>
                        <li><strong>Do</strong> feel that you can change your mind: <span class="good-talking">“I originally 
                            thought ____ but now I think differently.”</span>
                        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> ask someone to represent an identity group. For example, do not ask: 
                            <span class="misstep-talking">“As the only ___ in our group, could you suggest how to fix this?”</span> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>By asking someone to represent their group, you are unfairly 
                                    asking someone to serve in that role to suit your needs. You need to let people 
                                    choose which identities they bring forward for themselves.
                                <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“We need to understand a 
                                    range of perspectives on this. Personally I know that I need to do some work to learn more about
                                    race.”</span>
                                <li>Speak from your own place of concern: <span class="good-talking">“I feel concerned 
                                    about making a misstep in this area.”</span>
                                </ul>
                        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> put down another person’s ideas even if you disagree. For example, 
                            do not say: <span class="misstep-talking">“That’s a terrible idea, that wouldn’t work.”</span> 
                            or <span class="misstep-talking">“You really don’t know what you are talking about.”</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>People may have had different experiences from you. It’s ok for you to disagree, 
                                    and you can find a way to bring your perspective forward. At the same time, 
                                    this training is a time to be open and hear from others; maybe there is a way of 
                                    thinking you haven’t considered. If you shut down other people, you can’t expect 
                                    them to listen to you when you weigh in.  
                                <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“It sounds like 
                                    your experience is quite different than mine -- would you be willing to share more?”</span> 
                                    or <span class="good-talking">“Hm, I am not sure I see that perspective. 
                                        Can you say more about how that would work?”</span>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Scenario Activity</h3>
                    <h4>Duration: 10 minutes</h4>
                    The following scenario activity is intended to spark a conversation about 
                    how to respond to a situation that could arise during a mentoring session. 

                        <ol>
                            <li>Introduce yourselves with names and pronouns, if you want to be referred to 
                    using pronouns.
                            <li>Pick one group member to act as the facilitator; this should be someone who did 
                                not have a chance to practice facilitating in the last session.
                            <li>The facilitator can: 
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Read the scenario out loud.
                                    <li>Give everyone a moment to reflect using the prompts below.
                                    <li>Do a round robin (call on each person) to share initial thoughts. <br/>
                                        <blockquote>What are your initial thoughts on the scenario? Please keep your comment brief; this
                                        is just to open up the conversation and give everyone a chance to be heard.
                                        Since we're in a remote session, I'll call on you by name. You can 
                                        pass.</blockquote>
                                    <li>Open it up to a discussion, remembering to encourage all voices to be heard.
                                </ol>
                        </ol>
                    You can use following prompts to guide your conversation:
                <ul>
                <li>What could you say to shift the conversation? 
                <li>As a mentor in this program (where technical content is not core), what is appropriate for your role?
                <li>Are there things a mentor could say in this situation that might be well-intentioned, but have a negative impact? (intent v. impact) 
                </ul>         <br/>
            <p><b>Scenario</b><br/>
            You’re at the end of Session 3 during the unstructured time for discussion; 
            the CS Challenge activity was based in Vim. One of the students asks about IDEs (Integrated Development Environments); 
            <blockquote>Do you all use Microsoft Visual Studio Code? I’m planning to write an extension for cloud 
                computing with Azure.</blockquote>
            A couple others join in, and your co-mentor (who is very familiar with VS Code and the Azure platforms) dives into the technical questions. Since your co-mentor is responding, you have been scanning to see if the cohort looks engaged. You notice that some of the students are completely silent and one looks very confused. Then a student privately messages you to say:
            <blockquote>I’m starting to really doubt if I should have participated in this program; I have no idea what we’re talking about.</blockquote>

            You were already worrying that the space is being dominated by jargon, and this confirms to you that some of the cohort is feeling excluded.
