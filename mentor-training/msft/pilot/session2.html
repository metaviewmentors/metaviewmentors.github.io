                    We are using Zoom for this training, giving us breakout rooms for small group work. To 
                    make the session as smooth as possible, we ask that you:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use a computer.</strong> In Session 2 particularly, you may need to use the screen share functionality to work in your group.
                        <li><strong>Rename yourself</strong> when you join the call. Use your first and last name, whether you are <strong>(A)</strong>spire, a <strong>(L)</strong>earn Ambassador or <strong>(O)</strong>ther, plus your pronouns if you use pronouns and want to be referred using pronouns, as in:
        <ul>
            <li>Mary Smith (A) she/her
            <li>Quinn Hanson (L) they/them
            <li>Corey Jones (O)
        </ul>

        At the bottom menu bar (in black) click on the <em>Participants</em> button, click on <em>rename</em>, update your screen name and click OK.  <br/>

        <li><strong>Stay muted.</strong>
        You should unmute when you speak in the smaller breakout rooms, and if called upon to share during the whole-group sessions. Too much background noise negatively impacts the experience for everyone. We will mute you if need be.

        <li><strong>Use video</strong> when possible. Plan to have your video on for all breakout sessions and much of the whole-group sessions. You can turn it off when we are screen-sharing or if your internet connection is not strong.

        <li><strong>Find Speaker/Gallery View.</strong> In the top right hand corner you will see a small icon that you can use to change from Speaker to Gallery view and back.<br/>

        <li><strong>Open the chat.</strong> This can be found along the bottom menu bar (in black) just to the right of the Share Screen button. You may need to click the More ... button. You can the chat ask a question or make a comment as we go through the session. You can either aim your message at <em>Everyone</em> or <em>privately</em> to a specific participant. Note that private chat messages with a host are visible to all hosts via the transcript after the meeting.

                    					<h4>Ground Rules</h4>
        <strong>Be open-minded.</strong> We may introduce ideas in the training that you are unsure about or have questions about. We ask that you stay open-minded to us and to your fellow mentors.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Be willing to be uncomfortable.</strong> We like to think of mentoring as something that is positive, and it is. Yet being an effective mentor means we may have to be uncomfortable with what we don’t know. It can also mean trying new things, or working with other mentors and with student mentees in ways that push us out of our comfort zone. This is when we learn. It doesn’t mean it is easy.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Speak from your own perspective.</strong> We want you to use “I” statements, which means you speak for yourself and from your own vantage point. It’s easy to say “we at Microsoft” or “we from this university” think or do things in a certain way. But, it helps if you only speak for yourself rather than for other people.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Be patient and allow space for all to learn.</strong> We recognize everyone is at different places in their learning and have had different experiences. For some of you, this may be a review, and you could facilitate training for others. We ask you to be patient and help others move forward. For this pilot to be successful, we will need everyone to be on the same page and at a certain level of comfort. Toward that end, please think about whether you should step up or step back. If you are someone who needs to push yourself and learn more, we encourage you to step up to the challenge. If someone in your group needs you for support, we ask you to step up to this challenge. If you are someone who knows the answer or knows what to do, please step back from time to time so others get a chance to participate.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Facilitation means interruption.</strong> We only have a limited amount of time with you during each structured session. As facilitators, we may need to interrupt your thought process and conversation. Please know we value your contributions, and we do not interrupt for a lack of care for what you have to offer. To respect your time, we will push forward, which can feel challenging. We name this now to flag it going in. Please know you will have opportunities to ask questions or share ideas, whether in the chat, through end-of-session exit cards, after the session and in other spaces.<br/><br/>
        <strong>What’s said here stays here; what’s learned can be shared.</strong> When people are learning, they may make missteps. We all say things that we wish we could revise. We ask that you do not leave the training space and refer back to what specific people said when they were practicing their mentoring. This way we can all relax a bit into learning. We do, however, encourage you to share anything you <i>learn</i>.

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Do</strong> clarify (mirror) what you hear: <span class="good-talking">“I’m hearing 
                            you say that… Did I get that right?”</span>
                        <li><strong>Do</strong> appreciate others for sharing: <span class="good-talking">“Thanks so much 
                            for sharing that with me.” </span>
                        <li><strong>Do</strong> feel that you can change your mind: <span class="good-talking">“I originally 
                            thought ____ but now I think differently.”</span>
                        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> ask someone to represent an identity group. For example, do not ask: 
                            <span class="misstep-talking">“As the only ___ in our group, could you suggest how to fix this?”</span> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>By asking someone to represent their group, you are unfairly 
                                    asking someone to serve in that role to suit your needs. You need to let people 
                                    choose which identities they bring forward for themselves.
                                <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“We need to understand a 
                                    range of perspectives on this. Personally I know that I need to do some work to learn more about
                                    race.”</span>
                                <li>Speak from your own place of concern: <span class="good-talking">“I feel concerned 
                                    about making a misstep in this area.”</span>
                                </ul>
                        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> put down another person’s ideas even if you disagree. For example, 
                            do not say: <span class="misstep-talking">“That’s a terrible idea, that wouldn’t work.”</span> 
                            or <span class="misstep-talking">“You really don’t know what you are talking about.”</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>People may have had different experiences from you. It’s ok for you to disagree, 
                                    and you can find a way to bring your perspective forward. At the same time, 
                                    this training is a time to be open and hear from others; maybe there is a way of 
                                    thinking you haven’t considered. If you shut down other people, you can’t expect 
                                    them to listen to you when you weigh in.  
                                <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“It sounds like 
                                    your experience is quite different than mine -- would you be willing to share more?”</span> 
                                    or <span class="good-talking">“Hm, I am not sure I see that perspective. 
                                        Can you say more about how that would work?”</span>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Scenario Activity</h3>
                    <h4>Duration: 10 minutes</h4>
                    The following scenario activity is intended to spark a conversation about 
                    how to respond to a situation that could arise during a mentoring session. 

                        <ol>
                            <li>Pick one group member to act as the facilitator.
                            <li>The facilitator can: 
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Pick one scenario for the group to discuss and read it out loud.
                                    <li>Give everyone a moment to reflect using the prompts below.
                                    <li>Facilitate a discussion and aim to encourage all voices to be heard.
                                    <li>If there is extra time, move to the second scenario. 
                                </ol>
                        </ol>
                    You can use following prompts to guide your conversation:
                <ul>
                <li>How might you respond to the situation? What might you suggest or say?
                <li>As a mentor (and not an instructor), what is appropriate for your role?
                <li>How can you frame your response to focus on the <em>problem solving process</em> and 
                    not the question itself? 
                </ul>          <br/>  
            <b>Scenario A</b><br/>
            You’re in Session 2 and just started the pair/trio activity on spotting the differences in code;
            one program is in Java and the other is in Python.
            You aren’t familiar with Python (and the fact that indentation specifies code blocks). You
             “pop in” to check on a pair (with 8 minutes left in the breakout). They are sitting there, totally
             silent. You ask them how it's going, and the students respond: 
             <blockquote>That was easy. We found all the 
             differences really fast by each working on one of them</blockquote>
             <blockquote>Yeah, I did the Python 
             one, even though I don’t know the language. Why is it that the Python’s indentation is different 
             here?</blockquote> 
             
             <!-- <br/><br/> -->
            <b>Scenario B</b><br/>
            You’re in Session 4, during the report back from the activity where they chose a plan to
            do/evaluate. You ask a representative from each group to share how that activity went. 
            You call on Student A 
            to report out, and they say:
            <blockquote>We chose the ‘every other’ plan….? It worked on all the maps you gave us. 
                        We tried to make new ones where it wouldn’t work, but we were unsuccessful. 
                        So, does it always work?” </blockquote>

            <div style="display:none">
                <p>Session 2 uses two short programs and asks students to spot 7 differences

                        <li><strong>Do</strong> clarify (mirror) what you hear: <span class="good-talking">“I’m hearing 
                            you say that… Did I get that right?”</span>
                        <li><strong>Do</strong> appreciate others for sharing: <span class="good-talking">“Thanks so much 
                            for sharing that with me.” </span>
                        <li><strong>Do</strong> feel that you can change your mind: <span class="good-talking">“I originally 
                            thought ____ but now I think differently.”</span>
                        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> ask someone to represent an identity group. For example, do not ask: 
                            <span class="misstep-talking">“As the only ___ in our group, could you suggest how to fix this?”</span> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>By asking someone to represent their group, you are unfairly 
                                    asking someone to serve in that role to suit your needs. You need to let people 
                                    choose which identities they bring forward for themselves.
                                <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“We need to understand a 
                                    range of perspectives on this. Personally I know that I need to do some work to learn more about
                                    race.”</span>
                                <li>Speak from your own place of concern: <span class="good-talking">“I feel concerned 
                                    about making a misstep in this area.”</span>
                                </ul>
                        <li><strong>Don’t</strong> put down another person’s ideas even if you disagree. For example, 
                            do not say: <span class="misstep-talking">“That’s a terrible idea, that wouldn’t work.”</span> 
                            or <span class="misstep-talking">“You really don’t know what you are talking about.”</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>People may have had different experiences from you. It’s ok for you to disagree, 
                                    and you can find a way to bring your perspective forward. At the same time, 
                                    this training is a time to be open and hear from others; maybe there is a way of 
                                    thinking you haven’t considered. If you shut down other people, you can’t expect 
                                    them to listen to you when you weigh in.  
                                <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“It sounds like 
                                    your experience is quite different than mine -- would you be willing to share more?”</span> 
                                    or <span class="good-talking">“Hm, I am not sure I see that perspective. 
                                        Can you say more about how that would work?”</span>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Scenario Activity</h3>
                    <h4>Duration: 15 minutes</h4>
                    The following scenario activity is intended to spark a conversation about 
                    how to respond to situations that could arise during a mentoring session. 

                        <ol>
                            <li>Pick one group member to act as the facilitator.
                            <li>The facilitator can: 
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Pick one scenario for the group to discuss and read it out loud.
                                    <li>Give everyone a moment to reflect using the prompts below.
                                    <li>Facilitate a discussion and aim to encourage all voices to be heard.
                                    <li>If there is extra time, move to the second scenario. 
                                </ol>
                        </ol>
                    You can use following prompts to guide your conversation:
                <ul>
                <li>How might you respond to the situation? What might you suggest or say?
                <li>Are there boundaries around your role as a mentor that could impact how you’d respond?
                <li>Are there aspects of emotional intelligence at play? You can consider both the emotional state 
                    of the student(s) and yourself. For example, how might your response shift if you empathize 
                    with the situation vs. do not understand the student’s perspective?
                </ul>          <br/>  
            <b>Scenario A</b><br/>
            A mentee shows up late to a session. They seem flustered and unfocused. When you ask them to share after 
            a video, the student begins to talk about their current CS class and starts to cry. They say:
            <blockquote>I feel like everyone else is “getting it” and that I just don't belong. 
                My TA told me that this isn't the case, but that if I'm really struggling, maybe 
                I should drop the class.</blockquote>
             
             <!-- <br/><br/> -->
            <b>Scenario B</b><br/>
            In a 1 on 1 meeting, a student says:  
            <blockquote>
            I’d like to ask you to help me with my CS homework. My professor talked about parameters, and I just didn’t know what was going on. The autograder just marked everything wrong. There is no feedback in this class and lecture is really confusing. I don’t know what to do, and sometimes I just avoid the course altogether.</blockquote>
