            <h4 class="collapsible">Will our sessions take place on Zoom or Teams?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            All of your mentoring sessions will take place on Teams. After this training concludes, there will be opportunities to ask questions about the logistics of hosting the meetings for your mentees in Teams. We are using Zoom for the training only because the external facilitators do not have access to drive the meetings in Teams and because Zoom had additional functions we sought for our training sessions.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">What's the best way(s) to respond to mentees' stories, especially if they are serious and/or sad?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            You can thank a mentee for sharing their story. You also can reflect back that you heard that they are experiencing something very difficult, so they can know you heard them. Sometimes a person wants to be heard and does not want you to problem solve a solution. If you are concerned by something you hear, remember you have your Mentor Teams Channel (and you can share without naming the student) or reach out to Angel Zhou to brainstorm.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">What if you feel like your experiences aren't good enough for mentees? Or if you do not have the right “overcoming adversity” story?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            Remember there is no perfect story, and your stories are absolutely good enough! The goal is to share a little bit about yourself and get your mentees thinking about the topic. We ask that you do some reflection on the topics before the sessions so you can be intentional with your stories. You’ll also prep with your co-mentor for the mentoring sessions by looking at the topics; typically in each session, one mentor does the opening story-share if they feel they have a relevant story for that video, while the other mentor will typically do the closing story-share on the other video. The pilot mentors said this was one advantage of working with a co-mentor: being able to share the space and complement one another.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">What if someone does not want to share? How do we navigate silence in the program?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            These are great questions. We will practice inviting mentees to share and allowing them to pass. This is so important in a remote environment, where if you allowed only those with their hands up first to go, you’d tend to hear from the same people. You might also encourage quieter students to use the chat to share or to signal when they want to be called on. It’s ok to have some silence in the group. You can ask people to deliberately take a few minutes of quiet to think about what they heard, about the activity, or a recent class period at their university/college. This practice of breaking out into pairs/trios/small groups and coming back together also helps people warm up and share what they talked about with another person.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">Will we be given agendas and activities for the mentoring sessions in this program?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            Yes! This mentoring program follows a structured curriculum so that all programs are running the same topics in the same weeks; all mentees will gain a similar experience. You are provided <a href="resources.html#toolkit">three key resources</a> as a mentor. Please refer to the resources page to find the following. First, you have a mentor toolkit. This PPT deck contains explanations of each session along with tips, organized week by week. You and your co-mentor will draw from this resource as you get to know each other and prep for your sessions. Second, you have mentee slides. These slides you can display during the sessions so there is no need to figure out what to share. Third, you have the video pack. You will be showing the videos via YouTube in each session.
            <br/><br/>
            You will meet with your cohort of mentees for 6 weeks in group sessions. Each session has agendas and activities (including the story-share for videos plus a short CS challenge). The structured activities are designed to take around 90 minutes, although some mentors move through the material more quickly or slowly. You have flexibility to adjust according to the interests of your mentees (as well as the interests that you and your co-mentor have). The reason why we have included this curriculum is it helps all participants have some anchor activities to engage in together which sparks the conversation and makes it easier for mentors, regardless of experience, to lead the sessions.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">How commonly do we need to guide students away from thinking of us as tutors and towards thinking of us as mentors?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            While the mentees who sign up are advised that you are not tutors, and why we were deliberate to include activities that are very different than they will be seeing in their courses (e.g., none of our CS challenges include actually coding solutions), it is always possible someone may ask you to stay on the call to help them with a course question. You should only answer questions you feel comfortable addressing. It’s perfectly acceptable to say, “While I’m willing to try to help you, I’d also like to strategize with you where you can get the best academic support possible. Since I am not at your institution or in this program of study, I do not want to steer you in the wrong direction.” If mentees are nervous to approach their peer tutors or instructors, you could help encourage mentees to be brave by engaging in role play or talking through their concerns.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">What about that bad impact of the mentors which was mentioned? We did not get any examples of that. Could we get examples of bad stories or mistakes that can be made? Also, could we get super clear guidelines of what NOT to say or do, that would be helpful go over.</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            In a forthcoming session we will role play a few “missteps” a mentor can make. One of the self-guided assignment resources helps walk you through microaggressions to avoid </span><span class="s2">and </span><span class="s1">strategies to affirm and support your mentees. We want you to avoid singling out or stereotyping mentees based on their gender or race, for example. We ask that you uphold professional norms and expectations with your mentees as you are acting in a mentoring capacity. While these guidelines are helpful, we also want to encourage you to consider the affirming presence you can bring to the mentoring space by validating, encouraging, and inviting participation.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">You showed an example of where a mentor might revise their story about “the tech industry will eat you alive”. Doesn’t that reduce the authenticity of the mentor’s story?</h4>

           <p style="display:none">This is a great question. In the session, we talked about three things to consider when crafting your stories: (1) struggling before success, (2) being true or authentic to you, and (3) impact for the student. In this particular example, we were highlighting how an authentic story about struggle could be upsetting to share; hypothetically, so much so that they almost broke down crying thinking about it. There is a tension here between balancing points (1) and (2) with point (3) the impact the mentor wants to have: to encourage students to persist in tech. Sometimes it can be difficult to reconcile staying true to your story with the impact it could have on college students just starting their tech journey.<br/><br/>

            The revision we provided suggested that the mentor might connect to another moment that could help achieve their desired impact. Here, they remembered the support a teammate provided, which helped them to bounce back.<br/><br/>

            An alternative suggested revision is for the mentor to say, “I remember feeling at a low point about the tech industry and thinking that it would eat me alive. I did not let it keep me down.”<br/><br/>

            There is no one way to tell or revise a story. We hope the examples highlighted how you can be intentional around your role in the space and that you choose which stories to share. Be true to yourself and to the students, and at the same time, be mindful they are students starting the tech journey. The goal of this program is to help students build their tech resilience. We hope to leave them with strategies to bounce back in the face of difficulty.</p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">Can I observe an actual live mentoring session in progress?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            The mentoring sessions with the mentees are not recorded so unfortunately this is not possible. We will be simulating some of the program activities in our training sessions and we hope this will give you enough of an idea of what you will be doing in your role as mentors.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">How will co-mentoring work?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            Each co-mentor pair will find their own way of navigating a way of sharing the leading and the listening. In very practical terms, you can divide up the session in terms of who will lead which part (for example, one mentor might want to lead off the first story-share because they really resonate with that video, whereas another mentor might be excited about the CS challenge that day.) You can decide up front how to do this in your prep week (what we call Week 0 in the Mentor Toolkit) or you can agree to adjust on a weekly basis so you each get to try leading different parts of the curriculum. In the training, we will model some strategies you can use to strengthen your communication with your co-mentor so you two can be on the same page.<br/><br/>
            The other practical dimension of co-mentoring is to address the cohort size: every program has 12-16 mentees. You will divide up the mentees in half; each of you will have “your” mentees for 1:1 meetings at the start of the program (during Week 1, after the group session) and at the close of the program (Week 6). During the program sessions, we encourage you to mix mentees up in different ways (not only with their primary mentor) so the cohort can connect, although co-mentors have the freedom to decide how to best do this. You might decide initially in the first and second sessions to spend more time with “your” mentees as people are getting to know each other.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">How will we be matched to a co-mentor?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            Co-mentors will be matched based on a variety of factors, including your role, lived experiences, and comfort with different aspects of facilitation. While colleagues might naturally gravitate toward one another based on shared interests or experiences, this is not necessarily what promotes the complementary perspectives that can optimally support mentees. This means you may be stretched out of your comfort zone by your co-mentor match. Your participation in this program will be enhanced by the learning you gain from your co-mentor, beyond the work with your mentees.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">I'm not sure if I did active listening well. I had wished there was a little bit more guidance and verification if I was doing the activities correctly. I sometimes get attention fatigue and I zone out although I want to actively listen. Are there good ways to manage that especially when trying to be actively engaged for long periods of time?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            Thank you for raising this. No one is perfect at active listening; it is something that grows with practice! Initially we are looking for you to try out this skill before you move into asking for feedback from one another. While there may be some moments for feedback in the breakouts, our sense is that comfort giving and receiving true feedback often comes after people have built a certain level of trust. As you and your cohort work together, we hope you can request feedback from your co-mentor and your mentees. For example, you may find you can ask your co-mentor, “did I miss anything?” or “what did you notice?”
            <br/><br/>
            We certainly recognize and hear your note on attention fatigue. Our training sessions can feel intense as we try to respect your time and move through many different features. During your own program sessions, please do feel you can offer a break halfway through or offer for people to turn off cameras for a little while. You will find what makes sense based on the energy and comfort of the group.
            </p><br/>
            <h4 class="collapsible">How do we measure the success of our impact with the groups we will be assigned to, so that we can keep improving?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">
            This is a great question. We do have a survey link you will share with mentees after the first program session and the last group session. These are collected by the program coordinator and this will give the program a view in aggregate about how the groups experienced the program. We hope this feedback and the feedback you provide to the program will help the program to improve. In terms of your own feedback seeking, we hope you will seek feedback from your co-mentor, informally from your cohort (e.g., asking if they want to see anything definitely discussed during the next session, asking for input on what is helping them to participate), from the Teams channel for this program, or from your program coordinator. Microsoft will be looking for feedback from both mentees and mentors to assess the impact.

                <h2>Session 2</h2>
            </header>
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">A lot of the participants (mentors) are just out of college whereas some of us have graduated a while ago. This clearly reflects in the stories and experiences we come up with in the breakouts.. Wondering whether the stories that we want to tell in the actual sessions should be from our college days/internships - whether these would make them more relatable with the students or is it fine to share experiences from our work experience? Appreciate any guidance that you can share!</h4>
            <p style="display:none">This is a great question. It is better to tell a story that you feel comfortable with and is vivid in your mind than to feel you must generate a story from your college days. There is no “correct” setting to draw your story from, but you’ll probably find that professional or academic settings feel more relatable than a personal moment. It is often a matter of making the connection (e.g., “although I am in a role where I review code of more junior colleagues, perhaps there is something that resonates with you as you think about starting your journey of learning CS”). And remember: you can ask your co-mentor for feedback on your story, and you can be strategic about choosing who will introduce which video/topic during a session.</p>
            
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">What if I as a mentor don't resonate with a particular case/story?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">Everyone brings their own lived experiences and perspectives to the space, and this is an important piece of the group setting. We selected a set of topics and key questions that we anticipate are broad enough that at least some members of your cohort will find something they resonate with. If you or a mentee find you don’t resonate or relate to a particular moment or topic, it could be a chance to broaden perspectives for yourselves and the group. You can reflect on what factors might impact why you don’t resonate while others do. Here is where active listening can come into play. If you are able to talk with a friend or colleague about the topic before the session, you may find it resonates with them, and you could come to see their perspective. You can bring that with you to the session, perhaps noticing that while something did not affect you personally, you connected with a friend where this did play a role. In this way, you can still bring a dimension of empathy by recognizing how this could be relevant to another person.</p>
            
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">How would be the best way to handle it if none of the mentees want to share, even after the mentors have given their own thoughts? What if no one talks? What do we do in the silence?</h4>
            <div style="display:none">
              <p>This is a great thread for the Teams channel, and we also hope you ask the experienced mentors if this ever happened during their Q&amp;A. The opening video and the CS challenge are done in pairs/small groups; when mentees are asked to share, they are reporting back on what happened and what they discussed or did. In those cases, it is really rare that mentees would not share.</p>
            <p style="display:none">Remember with individual silence/passing, you can always come back and invite them to share later.</p>
            <p style="display:none">You may find you have a quiet group. Here are a few starting thoughts:</p>
            <ul class="ul1">
              <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Sometimes it can help to stay in the silence for a bit; it may be that people need some time to digest. You can note this as well (“We’ll try sitting in this silence for a minute. If you want, take the time to jot some thoughts down on paper or just reflect on what you might share.”)<br>
            </span></li>
              <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">You can ask what the silence means: does it mean they want to change gears or perhaps it is difficult to share in the larger group? If the former, you can shift gears and move into another direction. You could encourage people to write in the chat some ideas or break people into pairs to generate ideas. If the latter, you and your co-mentor can divide up into smaller little groups with your own half of the mentees to talk about the topic in smaller groups.<br>
            </span></li>
              <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">It might be that the students will share through a different modality. Try inviting them to each type a response in the chat, but to NOT hit return. Wait a couple minutes (it’s usually clear from body language if cameras are in when they’re done), then ask them to hit return. Sometimes seeing everyone’s responses can help it to feel less like a weight is on a particular participant to share and will help to create more space.<br>
            </span></li>
              <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">You can try a group poll to gather more information (about the modality, topic, etc.)<br>
            </span></li>
              <li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Sometimes telling a random story or using an icebreaker can reset the interaction; if it’s something that makes you seem more approachable, it can help to lower communication barriers.<br>
            </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feel empowered to change it up if it is not working. You can always try something, see if it works and revise. (And you can name this for the group if you want to give them a heads up -- “We’re going to try something a little different now in the hopes that it can help us dig in a bit more.”)</p>
          </div>
          
          
            <h4 class="collapsible">How soon will we find out who our co-mentors are? How will you match us?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">Your matching will be predicated on completion of the training. All efforts to match you will be made. We will be looking at logistical constraints (what program times you selected), complementarity in role, educational trajectory, lived experience, and confidence with the various aspects of the mentoring role. We will use your responses from the sign-up form as well as from your self-guided activities to help in this process. We hope through the training, you have gained a sense that having mentors with different strengths and perspectives will bring a richness to the mentoring program. We expect to make the co-mentor announcement approximately one week after training closes.</p>
            
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">How will round robin work with a co-mentor?</h4>
            <div style="display:none">
              <p>You and your co-mentor can decide what will work best for you. One option is to split up the different round-robins and assign one co-mentor to facilitate. That co-mentor can invite everyone to share, then synthesize and reflect back what they heard; they might then ask their co-mentor if they have anything to add. With a larger group, this might be better tag-teamed: one co-mentor asks the first half to weigh in before synthesizing and reflecting back, then the other co-mentor moves onto the second half. You can also consider a selective round robin, calling on people who have not yet had a turn in that session, then asking if anyone else wanted to share after they synthesized some things they heard. With the selection, be thoughtful of who you invite; it can sometimes lead to certain voices dominating the space.</p>
            <p >There is no one way to facilitate a session. It is typical that co-mentors alternate and/or share the responsibilities in some way so both of their voices (and facilitation strengths) are part of the session.</p></div>
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">Two hours doesn't seem like a lot of time if our group ends up having 12+ people. What's the best way to economize time and make sure everyone has an opportunity to participate?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">The opening video and CS challenge are all done in pairs and small groups. All mentees will get a chance to talk to a partner and other mentees. Be cognizant of who gets invited to report back on these activities for their pair or small group. That way in the closing round robin you can invite those who have not yet had a chance to share first. Remember there are multiple sessions; after the second session, even with 16 mentees, there should be a chance for every student to be invited to share out something even if in the first session it doesn’t turn out that way. Even if mentees do not get invited to share out, they will have actively participated.</p>
            
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">Is there a way for me to get better at this somehow? I found facilitating kinda hard still. How might I recover from mistakes in speaking? How do we strike a balance between being an active facilitator and active listener?</h4>
            <p style="display:none">Remember, you’ll get better with practice and experience. The more you keep facilitating, the more you will grow. This is part of why we offer training and a co-mentor model, so no one is navigating this process all by themselves. And every group dynamic is different and each session can be different. Show yourself some kindness if you make a misstep. There is no one way to recover from it. You can note it in the moment and that you are still learning. You can come back to it later if you find you couldn’t address it in the moment. Recognizing it can go a long way. And you can ask for feedback and support if you need it. Simply saying, “Hey co-mentor, I could use a little help with this part.”</p>
            
            
            <h4 class="collapsible">How does the group dynamic change when I'm the one that does not feel like I belong? How do we achieve belongingness throughout our careers?</h4>
            <div style="display:none"><p>Thank you for sharing this. We hear you and are grateful you raised this. We know that working in the tech industry does not necessarily mean you feel you belong, and we hope this program can play a small role in addressing this. It is certainly not an expectation we have of you as mentors. We mentioned that technical fields, workplaces more generally, and higher education all face the challenge of striving to live up to their promise to be more diverse and inclusive places. This program aims to foster a sense of belonging for mentees when they enter the mentoring space. Our hope is that co-mentors and their mentees can work together to create a space where folks feel they can bring themselves and be valued for who they are. We also hope you can keep in mind that a sense of belonging can be tied to situational and historical factors; even in a setting where people are making a conscious effort, we cannot expect this to automatically result in a space where everyone feels they are valued and respected. Remember intent vs. impact.</p>
            <p>We recognize that you as mentors come with your own trajectories and experiences; the tech field may not have created conditions that cultivated a strong sense of belonging for you. This can be a strength for you as a mentor if you choose to share pieces of your journey; your ability to persist can inspire your mentees and help those who do feel a stronger sense of belonging engage with the factors that are at play. We hope this program can help tech become a place where belonging is possible for all or at least take a step towards a larger understanding as to why it is not right now.</p>

            <h4 class="collapsible">Are we able to email students between sessions? For a student that may be shy or didn't get the chance to flesh out their thoughts, I thought it might be useful to email them in between sessions. Or in cases where the mentors weren't able to discuss a point in the detail they would've liked.</h4>
            
            
            <p style="display:none">This is totally up to you! You can offer to follow up with a mentee via email or meet between sessions. We do not want you to feel obligated to do that if you do not have capacity. And we want to help you set boundaries around communication. Only offer what you feel comfortable doing and what you have capacity for. If you are able to do this, for the reasons you outlined, the mentee will absolutely appreciate it.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">I am disconnected from the education space for nearly 20 years now. I don't have a good sense for problems college students face today. So in one word relevant.</h4>
<p style="display:none">You bring other dimensions to the conversation, and your perspective will be relevant and helpful for mentoring. Even if you do not know what students are going through (and often, we can’t know), you can bring an empathetic, supportive voice to the mentoring space. In our experience, what students are looking for is connection and investment: someone to listen to them, encourage them, and offer useful insights. As you reflect on the topics in the toolkit, you may find that your vantage point and journey into/through the tech industry can help remind students that there are steps along the way. If you are able to share that discussions from the training or those that unfold during your program have an impact on your own or others’ approach towards working with a team/projects, you’ll probably find the students to be both surprised and inspired to hear that learning and growth doesn’t have to stop when they graduate.
  <br/><br/>
Keep in mind that you might be the only industry professional one student in the group has ever met personally (while others in the group may have many generations of college-going and/or tech experience in their families). At the same time, if you want to learn more about what college students are wondering about in today’s world, you do have access to some resources on-line. This piece highlights the impact of the pandemic on the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/print/quicktakes/2020/08/19/students-reporting-depression-and-anxiety-higher-rates"><span class="s2">mental health</a> of college students. Experiences of <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/12/10/food-insecurity-among-students-continues-during-pandemic"><span class="s2">food insecurity</a> among college students is also on the rise. From a technical perspective, there is a lot of variability in the nature of students’ introductory computer science courses, in terms of how large the classes are, the quality of feedback, and whether their learning includes any peer learning groups or sense of community. Please do ask the program coordinator, your co-mentor, or the Teams channel if you have specific questions as the program unfolds.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">I'm wondering what our interaction outside of our co mentor will be when the program is running- will we have regular check ins with the larger group?</h4>
<p style="display:none">Some co-mentors post to the Teams channel if they have questions and/or want to share. This is entirely up to you. There are no required gatherings of the group during the program out of respect for your time obligation, which during the program is already 2+ hours per week (time for the sessions and sync-up time with your co-mentor).</p>



<h4 class="collapsible">Is there a list of ground rules/guides for mentors and co-mentors to help facilitation. e.g. for keeping time: "It's OK for mentor A to interrupt co-mentor B by saying ‘In the interest of time …’ if co-mentor unintentionally spends 5+ minutes on a story." How to address conflicting input/feedback with your co-mentor?</h4>
<p style="display:none">While we do not wish to constrain your interactions with an explicit set of rules along these lines, you and your co-mentor could agree on some together. You’ll see that Week 0 of the Mentor Guide includes a “get to know you” session where you can talk about communication preferences. In addition, we did model the “time check” strategy and recommend at least discussing this as one possible way to signal the need to shift gears to one another. Many of you signed up indicating a goal of practicing/building collaboration skills, and you can reflect on the topics/strategies that came up in the videos (e.g., active listening, emotional intelligence) to guide you. You can broach harder conversations with phrasing like, “Since we are part of this mentoring program, I want to be really intentional about modeling and practicing the topics/strategies we will be engaging the students in…”</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">Wondering if I need to schedule time each week with my co mentor to prep before each training or if email is sufficient for prep ahead of each training.</h4>
<p style="display:none">That is really for you and your co-mentor to decide. Talk to each other about what will work for the other, and be willing to be flexible and meet the other person partway.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">How do we get paired with our mentors? I'm concerned about potential time zone/schedule conflicts depending on who I get paired with.</h4>
<p style="display:none">You will be matched with someone who can do the same program time slot as you can. This is the same approach we used in the Fall pilot, where mentors were able to successfully find a sync-up time. We are confident you will be able to find a way to coordinate, even if it is just before or after the program time slot.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">How to handle a student that may not be interested and distracting to the group. How I would implement being resourceful during difficult or awkward situations after a group activity? How do you ensure that all mentees feel included, even when they have experiences or ideas different from the group, without being patronizing or calling someone out?</h4>
<div style="display:none">We will suggest a few ideas, but remember that you can brainstorm with your co-mentor or the broader set of mentors on the Teams channel. Also keep in mind that students will be coming from a variety of situations and sometimes external factors that they may not be ready to share can impact participation. Sometimes switching the modality of expected interaction can help -- this could mean using a poll, spinning up smaller breakouts, using the chat to have everyone enter some thoughts before asking all to share, etc.</p>

<p>Let’s say you see a few people on their phones or not engaged. Perhaps cameras are off; sometimes reminding students what a difference it makes to see their faces can switch a few cameras on. You can invite the engagement of the whole group and say something like, “We’re really looking forward to all of you tuning in today. There are only a few more sessions, so let’s make the most of this time together. You may have a lot on your plates or be feeling tired, so let’s have everyone write in the chat whether you’d like to take a break in one hour to check messages and stretch.” The positive of this approach is everyone hears this message. The downside is that the student you are concerned about may not tune in, and others may feel you are avoiding direct communication (if it is obvious if it is one student who needs addressing). Remember that you can call in versus call out.</p>

<p>Let’s say someone wants to pursue a tangent that is not really relevant to the topic for the day. For this, you might try a parking lot solution. “That’s an interesting question, X, and I wonder if we can put that in the parking lot to come back to during the open conversation time. [If we run out of time, I’d be happy to talk about that with you offline.]” At the end of the session, you can review the parking lot. If needed you can say, “X, I heard that you wanted to talk about ___, but we’ve run out of time. I’ll follow up with you on email/we can make sure to create space for this next week.” The last part is optional; you could alternatively suggest, “Perhaps you could look into that before the next session and report back.” </p></div>

<h4 class="collapsible">How to address inappropriate language during a session </h4>
<p style="display:none">Since there may be different assumptions for what language is appropriate, you might ask if people need anything else from the group in order to participate fully while reviewing the ground rules. If you observe language that is inappropriate, you can always tie this back to the ground rules in this way, “I’m hearing that this topic is bringing up a lot of emotion. Sometimes we express that using really strong language. I’m just noticing that we also want this space to be inclusive, so that means letting people express themselves how they choose and also being intentional as we think about impact on others.”</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">Other interaction questions: “How to deal with a younger crowd”; “During the exercises in the breakrooms, everyone is kind and reasonable, but I would like to hear some more "real" cases where a first attempt to fix it didn't work”; “How much freedom we'll have to modify/deviate from the curriculum”; “If we're allowed to go off book and do things like icebreakers to ease some of the uncomfortableness with strangers.”;”Would still love more practice with microagressions and microaffirmations.”</h4>
<p style="display:none">These are all great questions that we hope you can support each other through. The Fall pilot mentors did not find themselves in particularly difficult situations, so bear in mind that the training scenarios were to build some common ground, not to describe particular situations we expect will come up. There will be opportunities posted on the Teams channel if you do want to brainstorm with other co-mentors around these topics. The Mentor Guide will be updated with some suggestions for icebreakers.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">Possible difficulties with mentees being in very different timezones. Resolving technical questions from my mentees.</h4>
<p style="display:none">The students signed up indicating that they could participate in your program time slot. If there are technical issues, please use your best judgement or ask your program coordinator to help.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">If there's a way to practice creating and switching between breakout rooms in Zoom? Or How to use zoom to post polls, etc.</h4>
<p style="display:none">Your mentoring program session will be in Teams; you will facilitate breakouts through the Teams interface. [We had to rely on Zoom for our external facilitators for the trainings only.] </p>

<h4 class="collapsible">I’m curious about the exact structure of what the sessions with the mentees will be like. What type of content are we going to share with the students? And will we know for what purpose?</h4>
<p style="display:none">All of this information is available in the mentor toolkit. Please take a look at the Mentor Resource section of the website in order to see the agendas in every session.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">When does the mentoring program start?</h4>
<p style="display:none">Your programs start with co-mentor prep (week 0, March 14th), and your programs launch the week of Sunday March 21st.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">Who will we be paired with?</h4>
<p style="display:none">You will find out by March 1.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">What to do if a student misses a meeting?</h4>
<p style="display:none">That student will rejoin when they are able. You are not expected to help a student to catch up between program meetings. If you have capacity and want to, you can reach out to see if they need support or to offer to catch them up. Sometimes an email saying “We missed you at the last session and hope to see you at the next one” along with a reminder of the timing can be enough.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">How many mentees? Will the mentees be located anywhere in the world rather than US specific? How do we coordinate timezones?</h4>
<p style="display:none">All mentors and mentees may be located anywhere in the world. The students, just like you, fill out a sign up form indicating the time slots they can commit to. For initial 1:1s, you can use the second hour of Week 1, as the group session is planned for only the first hour.</p>

<h4 class="collapsible">How much planning is best for a session and how many extra activities can we have in case there is not a lot of discussion to take up the time</h4>
<p style="display:none">We will be updating the toolkit with some suggested topics that are related to each session. You can also brainstorm with your co-mentor and cohort to see if there are other ideas for what to discuss. </p>

<h4 class="collapsible">If students go into personal tangents in 1:1 sessions. What should the mentor do?</h4>
<p style="display:none">You will set the boundary as the session opens. It helps to say, “We only have a short check-in, so I hope to focus our conversation on learning more about how to support your participation in sessions (for example, learning how you communicate) and what interests you. If someone goes off track, it’s perfectly acceptable to steer them back. At the same time, if that is how the mentee wants to use the allocated time, there is no prescribed topic they *must* respond to. Everyone is different.</p>
