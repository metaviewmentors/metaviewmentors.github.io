                  <li>Explain how the story share works.
                  <li>Explain the format of the breakout: <em>In the sessions, you would typically share your story before the video. You would then ask students to break out and talk in pairs, and come back and share. In this simulation, I will share my story and immediately call upon 4 people to share if they resonated with the video in what is called a “Round Robin.” I will then synthesize and reflect back. This activity is done in every single session.</em>

                  <li>Share your story (2-3 mins) about self-efficacy.
                  <li>Invite 4-5 different participants in a selected round robin. 
                    <blockquote>X, would you be willing to share your thoughts about this video? It’s ok if you pass.</blockquote> 
                  <li>Then synthesize and reflect back what you heard. 
                  <li>There should be some open time for discussion. You can share your own reflections on the video pack 
                    and story share activity in particular. These prompts may be helpful:
                    <ul>
                      <li>How did sharing these videos open up conversation in the program, from your perspective? 
                      <li>Did you find that it became easier to do the share and facilitation as the sessions went on?
                    </ul>
                  </ol>
            We’ll give you a 5 minute warning before we pull you back into the Main Room and invite participants to share their experiences. </td>

                                  How did your co-mentor help you with anything that was “unexpected” or “went wrong”?</blockquote>
                              <li>To help you get a sense of what's on their minds, ask the group:
                                <em>Take a minute to reflect on the pivot activity you just completed and the training thus far.
                                  Is there anything you are wondering about or worrying about that might happen in the program that 
                                  you'd like to discuss today? Please use the chat to describe, but don’t press return! Once  
                                  everyone has had a couple of minutes to prepare their ideas, we'll have you hit the button
                                  and we'll get started. </em>
                              <li>After 2-3 minutes of wait-time, please go ahead and ask people to enter 
                                their response in the chat. Take a minute to skim over these. You can write down a 
                                few ideas of things you want to be sure to address after the prepared questions are done.
                              <li>Read through the chat and notice if anything stands out. Each of you can notice if any situations 
                                or topics did not arise. Take turns responding to what's been brought up, keeping an 
                                eye on time. 
                                You can share what did or did not happen in your own sessions and/or whether you shared
                                the same concerns.
