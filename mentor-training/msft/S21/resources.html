                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/0xT4mBgjg0w">How can I build my tech resilience?</a><br/>
                      Evidence shows that resilience, the ability to recover quickly from challenges, is a strong indicator of a learner’s success in a given field. People can tap into and grow their resilience.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/tZke7zw1eq0">What are we talking about? [Active Listening]</a><br/>
                      Active listening is an important part of communication and refers to a process of listening to understand the speaker, rather than simply responding. You can signal you value and respect another person by listening with purpose. 
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/zTiJfhvenRU">Can I do it? [Self-efficacy]</a><br/>
                      Self-efficacy is the belief in your ability to succeed in achieving a specific goal or task. The higher your self-efficacy is, the more you believe you are capable of accomplishing the task. 
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/c0vjzdVojKw">Is it possible for me to do this? [Mindset]</a><br/>
                      Research has demonstrated that having a growth mindset toward learning can improve resilience and a students’ ability to succeed. A growth mindset is reflected through a passion for learning, not a hunger for approval; people don’t see themselves as failing, but as learning.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/P6djsqiiXRM">Is this for me? [Belongingness, Part 1]</a><br/>
                      According to Brené Brown, fitting in is different than belonging. She writes, “Fitting in is about assessing a situation and becoming who you need to be to be accepted. Belonging, on the other hand, doesn’t require us to change who we are; it requires us to be who we are.” Whether or not we think we can do something may influence our sense of belonging in tech fields.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/mX6cQKFelf0">Is this for me? [Belongingness, Part 2]</a><br/>
                      Belonging is not always about whether you believe you can do something. It is also about whether you see yourself as a “tech person“ or as part of the “tech community.” This component of belonging is related to mindset: the static idea of a “tech person” or “the tech community” can indicate a fixed mindset about who is in tech. 
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/OoM3oNIYUFc">How can I do this strategically? [Self-regulation]</a><br/>
                      One thing that can help us to push through a challenging project is the ability to step outside of our own thinking and strategize about our plans. That capacity to create a plan, try it out, see how it works before regrouping and try again is called self-regulated learning.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/FUHktK96sjA">What can I do to get through this? [Emotional Intelligence]</a><br/>
                      Emotional intelligence (EQ) is defined as the ability to identify, name and manage your emotions. Exercising your emotional intelligence can help you improve your interactions with others. EQ isn’t typically taught in a CS curriculum, but is essential for the workplace, and importantly, you can grow this skill with practice.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/cHHEhevWZYE">Where do I go from here? [Cognitive Flexibility]</a><br/>
                      The ability to pivot and change is called cognitive flexibility. Cognitive flexibility goes beyond pivoting about plans. It’s also about stretching our imagination to see ourselves and others in our environments in new ways, which is especially important in tech fields.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/-WkQfgnU8GE">Where did that come from? [Giving and Receiving Feedback]</a><br/>
                      Feedback can vary widely in its content and delivery. Sometimes it’s hard to extract the next step or how to improve. Perhaps we’re only told that we went down the wrong path, and we have to continue the conversation to clarify the message.

          <strong>How might you use these materials?</strong> We heard that some Fall 2020 pilot mentors printed a copy of the mentee slides and wrote their own annotations with notes they wanted to remember to emphasize as they went along. Other mentors kept a version of the Mentor Guide agenda from the  handy to roughly follow the suggested timing. You and your co-mentor will find the system that works best for you.

                      <h2>Program Structure</h2>
      				</header>

              You and a co-mentor will guide a cohort of 12-16 students through a structured program that runs for 6 weeks.   
              <ul>
              <li>Prior to the official program launch, you will meet to prep with your co-mentor. [Week 0] 
              <li>There are 5 structured group sessions. [Weeks 1-5] 
              <li>Following the first group session in Week 1, you and your co-mentor will divide up the mentee cohort in half; you will schedule short 1:1s with “your” mentees. You can schedule these 1:1s when it is convenient for you, but ideally these will take place before Week 2’s group session.
              <li>Following the last group session in Week 5, you will again meet with  “your” mentees 1:1. If you wish, you may schedule these 1:1s in Week 6 of the program. 
              </ul>
 <br/>
              <h3>Group Session Structure</h3>
              Every group session follows a similar structure with embedded activities that provide opportunities to 
              spark a mentoring conversation. 
              <ol>
                <li>Introduction with a worksheet that prompts the group to settle into the mentoring space.
                <li>Mentor story share + Video 1 to introduce a topic. Pair/small group breakouts and round robin.
                <li>CS challenge activity to provide a shared concrete experience. Pair/small group breakouts.
                <li>Mentor story share + Video 2 to introduce a topic. Closing round robin for whole group.
                <lI>Open time.
              </ol>

              The toolkit includes an agenda with suggested timing, which looks something like this:<br/>

                      					<h4>Boundaries and Professionalism</h4>
      In this mentoring program,
                          <ul>
      <li><strong>Mentors are facilitators.</strong> <br/>
      You will share your stories. You will lead students through activities and offer insights to them. You will encourage students to share their experiences, and actively listen as they share. You will be responsible for moving the group through the mentoring program so you should show up regularly and on time for the program.
      <li><strong>Mentors are coaches. </strong><br/>
      You will coach students by providing advice and serving as a sounding board. You will help them to leverage the resources to which they have access. You are not their teachers, tutors, or career development specialists. However, students may ask you to help fill in the gaps of what they are not getting from these individuals or to unpack what they are learning or experiencing. This may require some negotiation on the part of the mentor as you clarify your boundaries with the participating students.  
      <li><strong>Mentors are responsible role models.</strong><br/>
      You are responsible for setting the tone for an inclusive mentoring space. Your words and behaviors matter. Microsoft mentors are expected to uphold the same professional behaviors expected when you are at work at Microsoft.

    <h4 id="participation">Participation Strategies</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Group Polls</strong>: Each participant gives an <em>anonymous</em> opinion by clicking on questions on the screen. This allows the group to engage without hand-raising or speaking.
            <li><strong>Pair-Share</strong>: Participants break into pairs where each person shares with a partner about their experience and actively listens to their partner's experience. It is typical for the pairs to come back to the large group and a member of the pair shares out to the larger group. Many who find large groups difficult will participate in a pair-share activity. A pair-share can be done with trios. 
            <li><strong>Round Robin</strong>: This method of participation is typically saved for the end of a structured group session, before moving into open discussion. Each person is called upon to share, and can pass their turn. Some may choose to defer (come back to them), or skip their turn (do not participate). This method helps all voices to be heard.
                <blockquote>Because we’re in a remote setting, I’m going to just call on you, but you can pass. <br/>
                    X, we’d love to hear from you. Unmute yourself. Can you take a minute or so to tell us what resonated?
                </blockquote>
            <li><strong>Active listening</strong>: listen to understand
            <li><strong>Reflect</strong> back and <strong>synthesize</strong>: mirror what you heard and highlight common themes or salient differences
            <li><strong>Step up, step back</strong>: be aware of when to take up space, and when to make room for more voices
        </ul></div></div>

        <div style="display:none;border: 1px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"><div style="margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
        <ul>
        <li>Remember to practice <strong>active listening</strong>. 
        <li>As a facilitator, practice <strong>round robin</strong> 
            (or “selected round robin” on a subset of the group), 
            reflecting back and synthesizing.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reflect back</strong>: When your cohort shares their experiences, 
                you mirror or restate in your own words what you heard.
            <li>Rather than comment after each person shares (aside from thanking them or 
                clarifying what they said), hear back from each member first.
            <li><strong>Synthesize</strong> across the group: Highlight themes/commonalities 
                (<em>“it is interesting that all of you found this component of the lesson to be so
                     valuable.”</em>) or contrasts/differences (<em>“I noticed that this really 
                         resonated with some of you, while others of you felt less connected to it.”</em>)
        </ul>

                      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      				</header>
    	<h4 class="collapsible">I don't feel very confident about being a mentor. Should I still become a mentor in this program?</h4>
        <div style="display:none">
It’s perfectly natural to feel you may have more to learn as a mentor. By coming to training and fully engaging, we anticipate your comfort level will improve. There is time between the end of training and the launch of the program. This is intentional. First, the program organizers need time to finalize student recruiting and match mentors with campuses. Second, we need to provide you with time to look at the materials together with your co-mentor. You are entering a mentoring community of 150+ mentors who can field questions and the program coordinator (Angel Zhou) is also available to you.
        </div>
        
        
            	<h4 class="collapsible">This program has an unusual design. Why did you decide to use a co-mentor, group cohort approach rather than a traditional 1:1 matching model?</h4>
                <div style="display:none">This is a great question. One-to-one models have their benefits, yet they can also be intensive for both parties. For example, if  the match is slightly awkward, interactions over multiple weeks can be especially challenging to sustain. The co-mentor design allows students to meet more than one mentor; mentors also benefit as they share the responsibility and learn from each other too. The group cohort approach is used so students also meet each other and can leverage peer support. During a time that has felt very isolating for many students, this program fills a void by working to build peer community.
                </div>
        
        <h4 class="collapsible">My understanding is that we are not expected to help students get an internship at Microsoft. What if a mentee asks me to review their resume?
</h4>
        <div style="display:none">You are signing up as a mentor to help introductory students to advance in their tech journey. IIf a student asks you to review their resume, and you have time and want to, you can agree. If you do not wish to or do not have time, you can say, “Unfortunately that is out the scope of what I am able to do in this program. When the program ends, we could revisit this.” Or “Although I cannot help you with that, do you have someone at the campus career center who could help you? I’d be happy to brainstorm with you so you can get another set of eyes on that resume.”
        </div>
        
        <h4 class="collapsible">This program seems to be geared toward encouraging students to continue their tech journey. But what if we meet students and for some, it seems they should drop their CS class? </h4>
        <div style="display:none">This is a great question. We hope that as mentors you always put it back to the student to make their own decision. Even if you think, by initially listening, the student may be better served by dropping the class, we want you to pause a minute and consider the following. Many introductory students, especially students from underrepresented groups, are encouraged to drop when they do poorly or seem lost, or when they do not appear to be a “fit” for the field. It’s of course possible that dropping is a good decision, but we hope to make sure a student first feels they *can* be successful before they make that decision and that they also know others may feel they don’t “fit in” in tech. When someone is learning a new area of study, it is common to feel lost and make mistakes. This is part of growing. If after they persist they decide to choose a different path, we hope that mentors will have been part of a process that led them to figure out how they could keep going if they wanted to do so.
        </div>
        
        
        <h4 class="collapsible">Are these sessions confidential? Are there some issues that cannot be kept confidential?</h4>
        <div style="display:none">There are some issues that cannot be kept confidential. In short, mentors are unable to keep conversations confidential that include when mentees threaten to harm someone else or themselves, disclose sexual assault, or share that they have observed faculty, staff, or students who may be putting others in danger (e.g., faculty who are showing up under the influence of drugs or alcohol in class). Specific examples such as these will be provided so that everyone understands that if these are disclosed you would need to elevate or report this to your Microsoft mentoring program contact. You might say: “Thank you so much for sharing that with me. This is something that rises above what I am permitted to keep confidential. I will need to share this with my Microsoft mentoring program contact. Within my role, what can I do to help you to move forward from here?” If you are unsure, please consult with Angel Zhou.
