          <ol>
              <li><strong>Use a computer.</strong>
              <li><strong>Rename yourself</strong> when you join the meeting. Use your first 
                and last name, plus your pronouns if you use pronouns, as in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mary Smith, she/her
                    <li>Quinn Hanson, they/them
                    <li>Corey Jones
                </ul>
              <li><strong>Stay muted.</strong> You should unmute when you speak in the smaller 
                breakout rooms, and if called upon to share during the whole-group sessions. Too much 
                background noise negatively impacts the experience for everyone. We will mute you if 
                need be.
              <li><strong>Use video</strong> when possible. Plan to have your video on for all breakout 
                sessions and much of the whole-group sessions. You can turn it off when we are screen-sharing 
                or if your internet connection is not strong.

          <h4 class="collapsible">Ground Rules</h4>
          <div style="display:none;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
          <strong>Be open-minded.</strong> 
          We may introduce ideas in the training that you are unsure about or have questions about. 
          We ask that you stay open-minded to us and to your fellow mentors.<br/><br/>
          
          <strong>Be willing to be uncomfortable.</strong> 
          We like to think of mentoring as something that is positive, and it is. Yet being an effective 
          mentor means we may have to be uncomfortable with what we don’t know. It can also mean trying new 
          things, or working with other mentors and with student mentees in ways that push us out of our 
          comfort zone. This is when we learn. It doesn’t mean it is easy.<br/><br/>
          
          <strong>Speak from your own perspective.</strong> 
          We want you to use “I” statements, which means you speak for yourself and from your own vantage 
          point. It’s easy to say “we at Microsoft” or “we from this university” think or do things in a 
          certain way. But, it helps if you only speak for yourself rather than for other people.<br/><br/>

          <strong>Be patient and allow space for all to learn.</strong> 
          We recognize everyone is at different places in their learning and have had different experiences. 
          For some of you, this may be a review, and you could facilitate training for others. We ask you to 
          be patient and help others move forward. For this pilot to be successful, we will need everyone to 
          be on the same page and at a certain level of comfort. Toward that end, please think about whether 
          you should step up or step back. If you are someone who needs to push yourself and learn more, we 
          encourage you to step up to the challenge. If someone in your group needs you for support, we ask 
          you to step up to this challenge. If you are someone who knows the answer or knows what to do, 
          please step back from time to time so others get a chance to participate.<br/><br/>

          <strong>Facilitation means interruption.</strong> 
          We only have a limited amount of time with you during each structured session. As facilitators, 
          we may need to interrupt your thought process and conversation. Please know we value your contributions, 
          and we do not interrupt for a lack of care for what you have to offer. To respect your time, we will 
          push forward, which can feel challenging. We name this now to flag it going in. Please know you will 
          have opportunities to ask questions or share ideas, whether in the chat, through end-of-session 
          reflection, after the session and in other spaces.<br/><br/>
          
          <strong>What’s said here stays here; what’s learned can be shared.</strong> 
          When people are learning, they may make missteps. We all say things that we wish we could revise. 
          We ask that you do not leave the training space and refer back to what specific people said when 
          they were practicing their mentoring. This way we can all relax a bit into learning. We do, however, 
          encourage you to share anything you <i>learn</i>.

      <p><h3>Pivot Practice Activity</h3>
        <h4>Duration: 22 minutes</h4>
        This activity uses the same format as the final group mentoring session to give you familiarity
        with the format as well as practice with mentoring scenarios. <br/>
        
        <p>You'll spend <strong>4 minutes</strong> on each pivot prompt using a <em>fishbowl format</em>.<br/>
        <ol>
          <li>Co-mentor team: discuss. 
          <li>Everyone else: listen in. One person, please keep time.
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Your group is composed of 2-3 co-mentor teams. 
          <em>If you're missing your partner, please invite someone to
              partner with you; they'll participate twice.</em>

        <h4 class="collapsible">Tips for a productive conversation</h4>
        <div style="display:none;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> clarify (mirror) what you hear: <span class="good-talking">“I’m hearing 
                you say that... Did I get that right?”</span>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> appreciate others for sharing: <span class="good-talking">“Thanks so much 
                for sharing that with me.” </span>
            <li><strong>Do</strong> feel that you can change your mind: <span class="good-talking">“I originally 
                thought ____ but now I think differently.”</span>
            <li><strong>Don’t</strong> ask someone to represent an identity group. For example, do not ask: 
                <span class="misstep-talking">“As the only ___ in our group, could you suggest how to fix this?”</span> 
                <ul>
                    <li>By asking someone to represent their group, you are unfairly 
                        asking someone to serve in that role to suit your needs. You need to let people 
                        choose which identities they bring forward for themselves.
                    <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“We need to understand a 
                        range of perspectives on this. Personally I know that I need to do some work to learn more about
                        race.”</span>
                    <li>Speak from your own place of concern: <span class="good-talking">“I feel concerned 
                        about making a misstep in this area.”</span>
                    </ul>
            <li><strong>Don’t</strong> put down another person’s ideas even if you disagree. For example, 
                do not say: <span class="misstep-talking">“That’s a terrible idea, that wouldn’t work.”</span> 
                or <span class="misstep-talking">“You really don’t know what you are talking about.”</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>People may have had different experiences from you. It’s ok for you to disagree, 
                        and you can find a way to bring your perspective forward. At the same time, 
                        this training is a time to be open and hear from others; maybe there is a way of 
                        thinking you haven’t considered. If you shut down other people, you can’t expect 
                        them to listen to you when you weigh in.  
                    <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“It sounds like 
                        your experience is quite different than mine -- would you be willing to share more?”</span> 
                        or <span class="good-talking">“Hm, I am not sure I see that perspective. 
                            Can you say more about how that would work?”</span>
                </ul>

        This activity will give you practice facilitating with a co-mentor.
        To share the facilitation role, try out the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Co-mentor 1: invite each participant to briefly
                share one part of their response to the scenario.
              <li>Co-mentor 2: synthesize and reflect back across the responses. Ask co-mentor 1, "Is there
                anything I missed?"
              <li>Co-mentor 1: add onto the synthesis from your perspective.
          </ul>

        <p>Your group is composed of 2-3 co-mentor teams.
