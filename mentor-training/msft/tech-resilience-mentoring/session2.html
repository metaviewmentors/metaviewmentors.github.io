          <ol>
              <li><strong>Use a computer.</strong>
              <li><strong>Rename yourself</strong> when you join the meeting. Use your first 
                and last name, plus your pronouns if you use pronouns, as in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mary Smith, she/her
                    <li>Quinn Hanson, they/them
                    <li>Corey Jones
                </ul>
              <li><strong>Stay muted.</strong> You should unmute when you speak in the smaller 
                breakout rooms, and if called upon to share during the whole-group sessions. Too much 
                background noise negatively impacts the experience for everyone. We will mute you if 
                need be.
              <li><strong>Use video</strong> when possible. Plan to have your video on for all breakout 
                sessions and much of the whole-group sessions. You can turn it off when we are screen-sharing 
                or if your internet connection is not strong.

          <h4 class="collapsible">Ground Rules</h4>
          <div style="display:none;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
          <strong>Be open-minded.</strong> 
          We may introduce ideas in the training that you are unsure about or have questions about. 
          We ask that you stay open-minded to us and to your fellow mentors.<br/><br/>
          
          <strong>Be willing to be uncomfortable.</strong> 
          We like to think of mentoring as something that is positive, and it is. Yet being an effective 
          mentor means we may have to be uncomfortable with what we don’t know. It can also mean trying new 
          things, or working with other mentors and with student mentees in ways that push us out of our 
          comfort zone. This is when we learn. It doesn’t mean it is easy.<br/><br/>
          
          <strong>Speak from your own perspective.</strong> 
          We want you to use “I” statements, which means you speak for yourself and from your own vantage 
          point. It’s easy to say “we at Microsoft” or “we from this university” think or do things in a 
          certain way. But, it helps if you only speak for yourself rather than for other people.<br/><br/>

          <strong>Be patient and allow space for all to learn.</strong> 
          We recognize everyone is at different places in their learning and have had different experiences. 
          For some of you, this may be a review, and you could facilitate training for others. We ask you to 
          be patient and help others move forward. For this pilot to be successful, we will need everyone to 
          be on the same page and at a certain level of comfort. Toward that end, please think about whether 
          you should step up or step back. If you are someone who needs to push yourself and learn more, we 
          encourage you to step up to the challenge. If someone in your group needs you for support, we ask 
          you to step up to this challenge. If you are someone who knows the answer or knows what to do, 
          please step back from time to time so others get a chance to participate.<br/><br/>

          <strong>Facilitation means interruption.</strong> 
          We only have a limited amount of time with you during each structured session. As facilitators, 
          we may need to interrupt your thought process and conversation. Please know we value your contributions, 
          and we do not interrupt for a lack of care for what you have to offer. To respect your time, we will 
          push forward, which can feel challenging. We name this now to flag it going in. Please know you will 
          have opportunities to ask questions or share ideas, whether in the chat, through end-of-session 
          reflection, after the session and in other spaces.<br/><br/>
          
          <strong>What’s said here stays here; what’s learned can be shared.</strong> 
          When people are learning, they may make missteps. We all say things that we wish we could revise. 
          We ask that you do not leave the training space and refer back to what specific people said when 
          they were practicing their mentoring. This way we can all relax a bit into learning. We do, however, 
          encourage you to share anything you <i>learn</i>.

            This activity is intended to spark a conversation about keeping the mentoring space open.

            <h4 class="collapsible">Tips for a productive conversation</h4>
            <div style="display:none;margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Do</strong> clarify (mirror) what you hear: <span class="good-talking">“I’m hearing 
                    you say that... Did I get that right?”</span>
                <li><strong>Do</strong> appreciate others for sharing: <span class="good-talking">“Thanks so much 
                    for sharing that with me.” </span>
                <li><strong>Do</strong> feel that you can change your mind: <span class="good-talking">“I originally 
                    thought ____ but now I think differently.”</span>
                <li><strong>Don’t</strong> ask someone to represent an identity group. For example, do not ask: 
                    <span class="misstep-talking">“As the only ___ in our group, could you suggest how to fix this?”</span> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>By asking someone to represent their group, you are unfairly 
                            asking someone to serve in that role to suit your needs. You need to let people 
                            choose which identities they bring forward for themselves.
                        <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“We need to understand a 
                            range of perspectives on this. Personally I know that I need to do some work to learn more about
                            race.”</span>
                        <li>Speak from your own place of concern: <span class="good-talking">“I feel concerned 
                            about making a misstep in this area.”</span>
                        </ul>
                <li><strong>Don’t</strong> put down another person’s ideas even if you disagree. For example, 
                    do not say: <span class="misstep-talking">“That’s a terrible idea, that wouldn’t work.”</span> 
                    or <span class="misstep-talking">“You really don’t know what you are talking about.”</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People may have had different experiences from you. It’s ok for you to disagree, 
                            and you can find a way to bring your perspective forward. At the same time, 
                            this training is a time to be open and hear from others; maybe there is a way of 
                            thinking you haven’t considered. If you shut down other people, you can’t expect 
                            them to listen to you when you weigh in.  
                        <li><strong>Instead</strong>, you can say: <span class="good-talking">“It sounds like 
                            your experience is quite different than mine -- would you be willing to share more?”</span> 
                            or <span class="good-talking">“Hm, I am not sure I see that perspective. 
                                Can you say more about how that would work?”</span>
                    </ul>
              </ul>
          </div></div>
                      
            Instructions:
            <ol>
              <li>Introduce yourselves quickly: just your name and pronouns, if you use pronouns.
              <li>The person whose first name is closest to A is your group's <em>facilitator</em>.
              <li><em>Facilitator</em>: Read the scenario out loud, then invite each person into the conversation.<br/>
                <span class="good-talking">“X, would you be willing to share what you would do? 
                  Feel free to pass your turn or we can come back to you.”</span>
              <li>After all have been invited to share, open up to a group discussion to brainstorm the pros and 
                cons of how the mentor(s) could respond.
              <li>If you have additional time, discuss the additional scenario.              
            </ol>
                                  
            <b>Scenario</b> <br/>
            It's the open conversation time for the belongingness-themed session. A mentee had showed up late to the session. 
            He seemed flustered and unfocused. When you ask how classes are going, the mentee begins to 
            talk about his intro CS course. He says:

            <blockquote>I feel like everyone else is “getting it” and that I just don't belong. My TA told me that 
            this isn't the case, but that if I'm really struggling, maybe I should drop the class.
            </blockquote>
            
            What do you do?
            <br/><br/>
                        
            <b>Additional scenario</b><br/>
            It's the open conversation time at the end of the belongingness-themed session. Mentees start
            sharing what they did over the weekend, and one woman says:
            
            <blockquote>
            Well... Over the weekend, I went to a hackathon, and my team actually won first place. But, 
            when we were waiting for the bus that the hack had organized, someone turned to me and said, 
            “Are you in the right place? This bus is for a hackathon.”<br/><br/>

            It really made me feel like I don’t belong in tech, and now I'm questioning if I want to continue. 
            Is it like this in the workplace too?
            </blockquote>

      <ul>                
          <li>Reflect back: When your group shares, you mirror or restate in your own words what you heard. 
          <li>Synthesize across the group: Highlight themes/commonalities 
            (<span class="good-talking">“it is interesting that all of you found this component of the lesson 
            to be so valuable.”</span>) or contrasts/differences (<span class="good-talking">“I noticed that 
            this really resonated with some of you, while others of you felt less connected to it.”</span>) 
          <li>Rather than comment after each person shares (aside from thanking them or clarifying what 
            they said or wrote), hear back from the group first. Then reflect back and synthesize what you’ve 
            heard.

                Please share by composing a message in the chat, but don’t press enter just yet... 
                Once you've had a minute or so to write, I'll prompt you to hit enter and share."</span>

                <span class="good-talking">"X, What resonated for you about <strong>giving</strong> feedback?"</span>
              <li>After someone shares, simply thank them and move to the next person. <br/>
                <span class="good-talking">"Thanks so much for sharing. Y, are you willing to share? 
                Or you can pass if you’d like."</span>
              <li>Synthesize and reflect back what you heard.
            </ol>
          <li>If you have time, you can:
            <ul>
              <li>Brainstorm how you might handle a quiet group. What if everyone passes? What if you have
                a very talkative group? Or one person that doesn't seem to want to stop?
              <li>Have an open discussion about what you found surprising about synthesizing and reflecting back. 
                Did you find yourself strategizing what themes you might pull out? Would you have a different
                strategy if you knew you had a co-mentor facilitating with you?
