          During the scheduled sessions, you will be engaged in training components that lend themselves 
          to group engagement. In this self-guided work, you will undertake additional activities on your 
          own. You can expect each activity to take between 45 minutes and an hour; plan to a total of 3-4 
          hours. <br/>&nbsp;

                <h2>Self-guided Module #0: Get to know the program and toolkit</h2>
                <h4>Estimated time: 45 minutes</h4>

                This self-guided module will help you get acquainted with the program and the toolkit.
                To give you a better idea of your mentoring commitment:
                <ol>
                  <li>Review the program structure.
                  <li>Peek at the toolkit contents.
                  <li>Submit a checklist to confirm your understanding of the role.
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Part 1: Program overview</h3>
                  You and a co-mentor will guide a cohort of about 16 students through a structured program that runs for 6 weeks.   
                   <ul>
                   <li>Prior to the official program launch, you will meet to prep with your co-mentor. [Week 0] 
                   <li>There are 5 structured group sessions. [Weeks 1-5] 
                   <li>Following the first group session in Week 1, you and your co-mentor will divide up the mentee 
                     cohort in half; you will schedule short 1:1s with “your” mentees. You can schedule these 1:1s when 
                     it is convenient for you, but ideally these will take place before Week 2’s group session.
                   <li>Following the last group session in Week 5, you will again meet with  “your” mentees 1:1. 
                     If you wish, you may schedule these 1:1s in Week 6 of the program. 
                   </ul><br/>
                   
                   <b>Group Session Structure</b><br/>
                   Every group session follows a similar structure with embedded activities that provide opportunities to 
                   spark a mentoring conversation. 
                   <ol>
                     <li>Introduction with a worksheet that prompts the group to settle into the mentoring space.
                     <li>Mentor story share + Video 1 to introduce a topic. Pair/small group breakouts and round robin.
                     <li>collaborative exercise to provide a shared concrete experience. Pair/small group breakouts.
                     <li>Mentor story share + Video 2 to introduce a topic. Closing round robin for whole group.
                     <lI>Open time.
                   </ol>

                   The toolkit includes an agenda with suggested timing, which looks something like this:<br/>

                    Review the deck below, which provides more details of the program as a whole along with 
                    some insight into its design.

                <h3>Part 2: Mentor Toolkit</h3>
                The Mentor Toolkit includes 3 main resources:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="resources/TechResilience-Mentor-Guide.pptx">Mentor Guide</a> (for you to refer to)

                </ul>
                <br/><br/>
                
                To give you a glimpse into the toolkit, peek at the content for the beginning of
                Week 4's Learning Lab “Am I up for the challenge?”:

                <h2>Self-guided Module #1: Interrupt microaggressions & Offer microaffirmations</h2>
                
                <h4>Estimated time: 45 minutes</h4>

                Much of your engagement will be in a remote setting with a cohort of mentees. As a mentor, you
                play an important facilitator role by inviting participation. 
                Not all participation goes smoothly or positively.
                As this resource 
                (<a href="resources/ally-action-continuum.pdf">handout</a>) explains, 
                there is a continuum of action we can take when difficult moments occur, and we want to underscore the importance of having 
                access to many strategies. The good news is that some of what we have already practiced, including 
                active listening and reflecting back, will be useful. 
                <br/><br/>

                To help practice:
                <ol>
                  <li>Consider how to recognize and interrupt microaggressions through a scenario, which takes place during the second group session. 
                  <li>Consider how to offer microaffirmations
                    by continuing with the scenario work.
                  <li>Submit a reflection on this self-guided work.
                </ol>

                <h3>Part 1: Consider how to recognize and interrupt microaggressions </h3>
                <p>
                  Spend about 20 minutes reviewing the resources on microaggressions
                  and considering the scenario below. 
                </p>
                  <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                  When we invite participation, someone can say or do something that we don’t expect, even with group norms in place. 
                  As a mentor and facilitator, you hold a responsibility to respond in some way. 
                </p>

              
              <p><ol>
                <li>When microaggressions go unnoticed or unaddressed by the mentors, students (targets and observers) 
                  may feel less trust in the program. For a refresher on microaggressions, read 
                  <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/01/microaggressions">this short piece</a>.                   
                <li>Not all negative or uncomfortable group dynamics are caused by 
                  microaggressions, yet the strategies used to interrupt them can be helpful to mentors in a wide array of situations. 
                  Review strategies that can help mentors respond to microaggressions
                  by reading this <a href="resources/StrategiesToInterrupt.pdf">one-page handout</a> 
                  (adapted from this 
                  <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsc.edu/events/documents/Microaggressions_InterruptHO_2014_11_182v5.pdf">original resource</a>), 
                  which provides a set of communication strategies 
                  one can use to interrupt
                  difficult dynamics.
                <li>Consider this hypothetical scenario, which takes place during the second group session. 
                  You've just started a round robin, and here are the first two responses:

                    <blockquote>
                      Mentee 1: I remember being in a class in high school where I didn’t want to raise my hand. The teacher called on me 
                      and then asked me to defend my answer. I remember feeling he didn’t think I could do it. I guess I was the 
                      only woman and person of color, and I felt out of place. This has made it tough for me in tech.
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                      Mentee 2: Hmmm. I remember in high school feeling challenged by my teachers and that was a good thing. Are 
                      you sure the teacher meant it that way? I know that to make it in tech, we have to toughen up. Maybe that 
                      is what they meant by questioning you. Even if it’s hard, I feel like I can make it on my own. 
                    </blockquote>
                                

              <li>Would you be tempted to stop the conversation after Mentee 2 speaks, or would you continue the round robin? Why or why not?
                [Submit your response below]
              </ol>
              
              
                <h3>Part 2: Consider how to offer microaffirmations</h3>
                <p>Spend about 20 minutes reviewing the resources on microaffirmations before returning 
                  to the scenario.</p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                Mentors have the power to share microaffirmations throughout program sessions. These can
                help to cultivate a sense of belongingness.
              </p>

              
              <p><ol>
                <li>Read about microaffirmations
                  <a href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/microaggressions-and-micro-affirmations-0">here</a>.                   
                <li>Review strategies that can help mentors convey microaffermations
                  by reading this <a href="resources/StrategiesForMicroaffirmations.pdf">one-page handout</a>.                  
                <li>How could you offer a microaffirmation to Mentee 1?
                  [Submit your response below.]
                </ol>
              
                
                  <h3>Part 3: Submit your reflection</h3>
                  <p>Your mentor coaches will share a form with you.</p>
          
                
                  <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                  We hope the self-guided work will encourage you to try some new strategies. 
                  In addition, 
                  some of the responses you submit may factor in during the co-mentor matching process.

                <h2>Self-guided Module #2: Explore social identities
</h2>

                <h4>Estimated time: 45 minutes</h4>

                How can you create a space where all mentees feel invited and respected? 
                The next training session will emphasize how this program is designed with a co-mentoring team to support 
                and complement each other. Mentors can vary widely in their own lived experience and background in 
                collaborative interactions. We would be remiss if we did not apply “do no harm” to the mentors’ 
                experiences as well as to the mentees’. As a starting point, this self-guided work invites you to 
                consider how your social identity can factor into your mentoring and co-mentoring roles. 
                <br/><br/>

                To help examine the role social identity can play in this mentoring program:
                <ol>
                  <li>Complete the social identity wheel activity.
                  <li>Consider a set of scenarios.
                  <li>Submit a reflection on this self-guided work.
                </ol>
                
              
                  <h3>Part 1: social identity wheel activity</h3>
                  <p>Take about 15 minutes to complete the social identity wheel; 
                    this is one of the most widely-used activities to help people to explore their own 
                    social identities before they begin a role, including teaching or mentoring. 
                    It sets the stage for the first exercise you will do with your co-mentor as you prep for the program.</p>
                        
                  <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                    Some of our most important social identities may not be visible to others, and it can be painful when people make assumptions. If our most visible social identities are not how we define ourselves, it can lead to friction if we feel stereotyped or cast into a particular role based on that group identity.

                    We all come with histories and prior experiences. Some people have substantial experience reflecting on their own social identities, while others may not. Even those familiar with social identity terminology can continue to update knowledge. Please refer to

                    <h3>Part 2: scenarios</h3>
                    <p>The goal of this activity is to engage in perspective-taking, to reflect on students you may meet, and 
                      to consider how a co-mentor can complement and balance the mentoring space.
                      Take 25-30 minutes to consider how you might react to each hypothetical student.</p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                      Honest reflection is important as we engage with the topic of identity. It can be uncomfortable because of its connection to assumptions and stereotypes, but we are less likely to make assumptions (guess someone’s gender, conclude something about someone’s race or family background) when we put the work in to examine our perceptions. This is particularly important when we are serving as mentors. <br/><br/>

                      Reflecting on our social identities and the impact they could have on the mentoring space can be empowering. Our identities are assets that can bring unique perspectives to the mentoring program through our own lived experience. Self-reflection can help us to be more intentional about how we collaborate as co-mentors, serve as a starting point for gaining permission to “call in” our co-mentor when needed, and offer ourselves the space (and grace) to be life-long learners as we continue to grow in our knowledge.                       
                    </p>
                    
              
                  <ol>
                    <li>Read the descriptions of three hypothetical students and scenarios described below. 
                      
                      <h4 class="collapsible">Mentee A</h4>
                      <div style="display:none">
                      When you first meet with this mentee, they express anxieties about taking Computer Science. They mention 
                      that they are a first-generation college student and have no prior experience with programming in high school. 
                      During the first pair exercise where they engage with sample code, they share “I feel I am in over my head.”
                    </div>

                      <h4 class="collapsible">Mentee B</h4>
                      <div style="display:none">
                      When you first meet him, he tells you that he is a non-traditional age student and that hasn't taken a class 
                      in over 30 years. His kids convinced him to go back for computer programming. While he is very excited, he also 
                      shares that he is a commuter with limited time on campus. He is a little worried about how he will be accepted 
                      in the group during group projects. 
                    </div>

                      <h4 class="collapsible">Mentee C</h4>
                      <div style="display:none">
                      When you first meet this student, she starts telling you about some of her favorite programming projects in 
                      high school. She has mentioned quite a few technical terms and is very enthusiastic about studying computer 
                      science. You notice in the exercise that she and her partner finished up very quickly. She comments to the group, 
                      with a bit of annoyance, “Honestly, I am a little disappointed in this exercise. This was not challenging at all.”
                    </div>
                      
                      
                    <li>Reflect on the following (privately, this is a starting point):
                         <ul>
                           <li>Do you feel more/less comfortable with each scenario?
                          <li>If the mentee was described differently (e.g., a different background or identity) 
                            would your response change?
                          </ul>
                    <lI>Brainstorm a response to the scenario, using these prompts as a starting point:

                          <li>What can you say/do to shift this dynamic?
                          <li>How does having a co-mentor shift your response? Might you step up or step back?
                        </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                    This act of self-reflection can be very important as we think about 
                    how we bring ourselves into co-mentoring and the mentoring space.

            <h2>Self-guided Module #3: Frame the collaborative exercises</h2>
            <h4>Estimated time: 45 minutes</h4>

            Each learning lab (in weeks 2 - 5) is anchored by a collaborative exercise. These exercises provide
            an opportunities for mentees to apply the topics to a hands-on activity with a partner or partners. 
            This self-guided module is meant to be a booster as you head into your mentoring program. How will
            you frame the challenges so that your particular cohort gains valuable insight into their own problem-solving
            and collaboration processes?
             
            <ol>
              <li>Walk through a deck with insight on why and how to frame the collaborative exercises.
              <li>Focus on a particular learning lab and consider how you will frame its exercise.
              <li>Submit a reflection on this self-guided work.
            </ol>
    
            <h3>Part 1: Strike a balance</h3>
              Framing the collaborative exercises will require you to strike a balance in multiple ways.
              Review the deck below.
