                <div style="display:none">

                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/0xT4mBgjg0w">How can I build my tech resilience?</a><br/>
                      Evidence shows that resilience, the ability to recover quickly from challenges, is a strong indicator of a 
                      learner’s success in a given field. People can tap into and grow their resilience.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/tZke7zw1eq0">What are we talking about? [Active Listening]</a><br/>
                      Active listening is an important part of communication and refers to a process of listening to understand 
                      the speaker, rather than simply responding. You can signal you value and respect another person by listening 
                      with purpose. 
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/zTiJfhvenRU">Can I do it? [Self-efficacy]</a><br/>
                      Self-efficacy is the belief in your ability to succeed in achieving a specific goal or task. The higher your 
                      self-efficacy is, the more you believe you are capable of accomplishing the task. 
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/c0vjzdVojKw">Is it possible for me to do this? [Mindset]</a><br/>
                      Research has demonstrated that having a growth mindset toward learning can improve resilience and a students’ 
                      ability to succeed. A growth mindset is reflected through a passion for learning, not a hunger for approval; 
                      people don’t see themselves as failing, but as learning.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/P6djsqiiXRM">Is this for me? [Belongingness, Part 1]</a><br/>
                      According to Brené Brown, fitting in is different than belonging. She writes, “Fitting in is about assessing a 
                      situation and becoming who you need to be to be accepted. Belonging, on the other hand, doesn’t require us to 
                      change who we are; it requires us to be who we are.” Whether or not we think we can do something may influence 
                      our sense of belonging in tech fields.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/mX6cQKFelf0">Is this for me? [Belongingness, Part 2]</a><br/>
                      Belonging is not always about whether you believe you can do something. It is also about whether you see yourself 
                      as a “tech person“ or as part of the “tech community.” This component of belonging is related to mindset: the 
                      static idea of a “tech person” or “the tech community” can indicate a fixed mindset about who is in tech. 
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/OoM3oNIYUFc">How can I do this strategically? [Self-regulation]</a><br/>
                      One thing that can help us to push through a challenging project is the ability to step outside of our own thinking 
                      and strategize about our plans. That capacity to create a plan, try it out, see how it works before regrouping and 
                      try again is called self-regulated learning.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/FUHktK96sjA">What can I do to get through this? [Emotional Intelligence]</a><br/>
                      Emotional intelligence (EQ) is defined as the ability to identify, name and manage your emotions. Exercising your 
                      emotional intelligence can help you improve your interactions with others. EQ isn’t typically taught in a CS 
                      curriculum, but is essential for the workplace, and importantly, you can grow this skill with practice.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/cHHEhevWZYE">Where do I go from here? [Cognitive Flexibility]</a><br/>
                      The ability to pivot and change is called cognitive flexibility. Cognitive flexibility goes beyond pivoting about 
                      plans. It’s also about stretching our imagination to see ourselves and others in our environments in new ways, 
                      which is especially important in tech fields.
                    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/-WkQfgnU8GE">Where did that come from? [Giving and Receiving Feedback]</a><br/>
                      Feedback can vary widely in its content and delivery. Sometimes it’s hard to extract the next step or how to improve. 
                      Perhaps we’re only told that we went down the wrong path, and we have to continue the conversation to clarify the message.

          <strong>How might you use these materials?</strong> We heard that some mentors printed a copy of the 
          mentee slides and wrote their own annotations with notes they wanted to remember to emphasize as they 
          went along. Other mentors kept a version of the Mentor Guide agenda from the  handy to roughly follow 
          the suggested timing. You and your co-mentor will find the system that works best for you.<br/><br/>

                      					<h4>Boundaries and Professionalism</h4>
      In this mentoring program,
                          <ul>
      <li><strong>Mentors are facilitators.</strong> <br/>
      You will share your stories. You will lead students through activities and offer insights to them. You will encourage students to 
      share their experiences, and actively listen as they share. You will be responsible for moving the group through the mentoring 
      program so you should show up regularly and on time for the program.
      <li><strong>Mentors are coaches. </strong><br/>
      You will coach students by providing advice and serving as a sounding board. You will help them to leverage the resources to which 
      they have access. You are not their teachers, tutors, or career development specialists. However, students may ask you to help fill 
      in the gaps of what they are not getting from these individuals or to unpack what they are learning or experiencing. This may 
      require some negotiation on the part of the mentor as you clarify your boundaries with the participating students.  
      <li><strong>Mentors are responsible role models.</strong><br/>
      You are responsible for setting the tone for an inclusive mentoring space. Your words and behaviors matter. Microsoft mentors are 
      expected to uphold the same professional behaviors expected when you are at work at Microsoft.

    <h4 id="participation">Participation Strategies</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Group Polls</strong>: Each participant gives an <em>anonymous</em> opinion by clicking on questions on the screen. 
              This allows the group to engage without hand-raising or speaking.
            <li><strong>Pair-Share</strong>: Participants break into pairs where each person shares with a partner about their experience 
              and actively listens to their partner's experience. It is typical for the pairs to come back to the large group and a member 
              of the pair shares out to the larger group. Many who find large groups difficult will participate in a pair-share activity. 
              A pair-share can be done with trios. 
            <li><strong>Round Robin</strong>: This method of participation is typically saved for the end of a structured group session, 
              before moving into open discussion. Each person is called upon to share, and can pass their turn. Some may choose to defer 
              (come back to them), or skip their turn (do not participate). This method helps all voices to be heard.
                <blockquote>Because we’re in a remote setting, I’m going to just call on you, but you can pass. <br/>
                    X, we’d love to hear from you. Unmute yourself. Can you take a minute or so to tell us what resonated?
                    Feel free to pass your turn or we can come back to you.
                </blockquote>
            <li><strong>Share through the Chat</strong>: In a remote setting, this can be used to complement the spoken round robin.
              Sometimes, people may not feel as comfortable or ready to speak openly in front of the group. The chat gives
              people the chance to compose their thoughts and not be put "on the spot"; it can also give the opportunity 
              for more perspectives to be shared when time is tight.<br/><br/> 
              Invite participants to share in a written format, but have them wait for your prompt before entering it
              the group chat: 
              <blockquote>Let's try sharing in the chat. Prepare your response, but don't hit enter just yet...<br/>
                  Okay, hopefully you've had a chance to write something -- please go ahead and hit enter!
              </blockquote>
            <li><strong>Active listening</strong>: listen to understand
            <li><strong>Reflect</strong> back and <strong>synthesize</strong>: mirror what you heard and highlight common themes or 
              salient differences
            <li><strong>Step up, step back</strong>: be aware of when to take up space, and when to make room for more voices
        </ul></div></div>

        <div style="display:none;border: 1px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"><div style="margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
        <ul>
        <li>Remember to practice <strong>active listening</strong>. 
        <li>As a facilitator, practice <strong>round robin</strong> 
            (or “selected round robin” on a subset of the group), 
            reflecting back and synthesizing.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reflect back</strong>: When your cohort shares their experiences, 
                you mirror or restate in your own words what you heard.
            <li>Rather than comment after each person shares (aside from thanking them or 
                clarifying what they said), hear back from each member first.
            <li><strong>Synthesize</strong> across the group: Highlight themes/commonalities 
                (<em>“it is interesting that all of you found this component of the lesson to be so
                     valuable.”</em>) or contrasts/differences (<em>“I noticed that this really 
                         resonated with some of you, while others of you felt less connected to it.”</em>)
        </ul>
