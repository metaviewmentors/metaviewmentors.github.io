          <h4>Using Teams</h4>
            To make the session as smooth as possible, we ask that you:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Use a computer.</strong>
                <li><strong>Rename yourself</strong> when you join the meeting. Use your first 
                  and last name, plus your pronouns if you use pronouns, as in:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Mary Smith, she/her
                      <li>Quinn Hanson, they/them
                      <li>Corey Jones
                  </ul>
                <li><strong>Stay muted.</strong> You should unmute when you speak in the smaller 
                  breakout rooms, and if called upon to share during the whole-group sessions. Too much 
                  background noise negatively impacts the experience for everyone. We will mute you if 
                  need be.
                <li><strong>Use video</strong> when possible. Plan to have your video on for all breakout 
                  sessions and much of the whole-group sessions. You can turn it off when we are screen-sharing 
                  or if your internet connection is not strong.
            </ol>            
          <div style="border: 1px solid gray;border-radius: 5px;"><div style="margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
            <h4>Ground Rules</h4>
            <strong>Be open-minded.</strong> 
            We may introduce ideas in the training that you are unsure about or have questions about. 
            We ask that you stay open-minded to us and to your fellow mentors.<br/><br/>
            
            <strong>Be willing to be uncomfortable.</strong> 
            We like to think of mentoring as something that is positive, and it is. Yet being an effective 
            mentor means we may have to be uncomfortable with what we don’t know. It can also mean trying new 
            things, or working with other mentors and with student mentees in ways that push us out of our 
            comfort zone. This is when we learn. It doesn’t mean it is easy.<br/><br/>
            
            <strong>Speak from your own perspective.</strong> 
            We want you to use “I” statements, which means you speak for yourself and from your own vantage 
            point. It’s easy to say “we at Microsoft” or “we from this university” think or do things in a 
            certain way. But, it helps if you only speak for yourself rather than for other people.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Be patient and allow space for all to learn.</strong> 
            We recognize everyone is at different places in their learning and have had different experiences. 
            For some of you, this may be a review, and you could facilitate training for others. We ask you to 
            be patient and help others move forward. For this pilot to be successful, we will need everyone to 
            be on the same page and at a certain level of comfort. Toward that end, please think about whether 
            you should step up or step back. If you are someone who needs to push yourself and learn more, we 
            encourage you to step up to the challenge. If someone in your group needs you for support, we ask 
            you to step up to this challenge. If you are someone who knows the answer or knows what to do, 
            please step back from time to time so others get a chance to participate.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Facilitation means interruption.</strong> 
            We only have a limited amount of time with you during each structured session. As facilitators, 
            we may need to interrupt your thought process and conversation. Please know we value your contributions, 
            and we do not interrupt for a lack of care for what you have to offer. To respect your time, we will 
            push forward, which can feel challenging. We name this now to flag it going in. Please know you will 
            have opportunities to ask questions or share ideas, whether in the chat, through end-of-session 
            reflection, after the session and in other spaces.<br/><br/>
            
            <strong>What’s said here stays here; what’s learned can be shared.</strong> 
            When people are learning, they may make missteps. We all say things that we wish we could revise. 
            We ask that you do not leave the training space and refer back to what specific people said when 
            they were practicing their mentoring. This way we can all relax a bit into learning. We do, however, 
            encourage you to share anything you <i>learn</i>.

          <ol>
            <li>Introduce yourselves quickly: just your name and pronouns, if you use pronouns.
              <li>Speakers will go in alphabetical order by first name (whoever's first name is closest to "A" speaks first.)
          <li><em>Speaker:</em> Take 1-2 minutes to respond to this prompt: <br/>
              <strong>Reflecting on the active listening video, what resonated for you? Feel free to pass your turn or we can come back to you.</strong>
          <li><em>Listener:</em> Please do not interrupt when someone is sharing their story. You are practicing active 
            listening. Take 1 minute to say what you heard and what you took from the story. You can 
            <strong>mirror</strong> with phrases like: <span class="good-talking">“I heard you say…”</span> 
            or <span class="good-talking">“It sounded like...”</span>
          <li>[If you are in a trio] <em>Observer</em>: Listen and keep time.
          <li>Switch roles.
          <li>If you have additional time, use these prompts to discuss what the activity was like for you.
            <ul>
            <li>If you were in a “share role”: do you think you changed how you communicated 
              knowing that another person was actively listening to you?
            <li>If you were in a “reflect back” role: did you find yourself listening in a different 
              way when you knew you were the one reflecting back?

            <h4>Duration: 10 minutes</h4>
            In your mentoring sessions, you'll use a "round robin" to invite your mentees to reflect on how
            a topic resonates with them. You'll use this breakout to simulate this in small groups. <br/><br/>
            
            Instructions:
            <ol>
              <li>Introduce yourselves quickly: just your name and pronouns, if you use pronouns.
              <li>The person whose first name is closest to Z is your group's <em>facilitator</em>.
              <li><em>Facilitator</em>: Invite each person to share what resonated with them, giving them the opportunity
                to pass.<br/>
                <span class="good-talking">“X, are you willing to share what resonated for you? 
                  Feel free to pass your turn or we can come back to you.”</span>
              <li><em>Facilitator</em>: After everyone has had a chance to contribute, share what resonated with you.<br/>
              <li>If you have additional time, open it up to a group discussion about the experience using these prompts:
                <ul>
                  <li>Do you think hearing the story we shared before the video shifted what you shared?
                  <li>Did you notice any themes or commonalities across what your group shared?
                  <li>Did you notice any contrasts or differences?
                </ul>
