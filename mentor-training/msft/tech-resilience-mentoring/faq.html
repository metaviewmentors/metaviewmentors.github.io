      		<header><h2>Program design, session structure, co-mentoring and mentor role(s)</h2></header>
                      
          <h4 class="collapsible">This program has an unusual design. Why did you decide to use a co-mentor model and a group mentoring approach rather than a traditional 1:1 mentoring model?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">This is a great question. One-to-one mentoring models have their benefits, yet they can also be intensive for both parties. For example, if the mentor-mentee match is slightly awkward, interactions over multiple weeks can be especially challenging to sustain. The co-mentor design allows mentees to meet more than one mentor; co-mentors also benefit as they share the responsibility and learn from each other too. The group cohort approach is used so mentees also meet each other and can leverage peer support. During a time that has felt very isolating for many students, this program fills a void by working to build peer community.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What is the program session structure?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You will meet with your mentees for 6 weeks, 5 of which take place with your co-mentor and the entire cohort of mentees, and the very last week is for 1:1 meetings for you and your subset of mentees. The program follows a mentoring curriculum; each weekly session has agendas and structured activities (including the story-share for videos plus a short collaborative exercise). The structured activities are designed to take around 90 minutes, although some mentors move through the material more quickly or slowly. You have flexibility to adjust according to the interests of your mentees (as well as the interests that you and your co-mentor have). The reason why we have included this mentoring curriculum is it helps all participants have some anchor activities to engage in together which sparks the conversation and makes it easier for mentors, regardless of experience, to lead the sessions.</p>

          <h4 class="collapsible">Will we be given agendas and activities for the mentoring sessions in this program?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Yes! This mentoring program follows a structured curriculum so that all programs are running the same topics in the same weeks; all mentees will gain a similar experience. You are provided <a href="resources.html#toolkit">three key resources</a> as a mentor. Please refer to the resources page to find the following. First, you have a mentor toolkit. This PPT deck contains explanations of each session along with tips, organized week by week. You and your co-mentor will draw from this resource as you get to know each other and prep for your sessions. Second, you have mentee slides. These slides you can display during the sessions so there is no need to figure out what to share. Third, you have the video pack. You will be showing the videos via YouTube in each session.<br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How will co-mentoring work?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Each co-mentor pair will find their own way of navigating co-mentoring. You will share the leading, logistics, and listening. In very practical terms, you can divide up the session in terms of who will lead which part (for example, one mentor might want to lead off the first story-share because they really resonate with that video, whereas another mentor might be excited about the collaborative exercise for that day.) You can decide up front how to do this in your prep week (what we call Week 0 in the Mentor Toolkit) or you can agree to adjust on a weekly basis so you each get to try leading different parts of the curriculum. In the training, we will model some strategies you can use to strengthen your communication with your co-mentor so you two can be on the same page.<br>
          <br>
          The other practical dimension of co-mentoring is to address the cohort size: every program has 12-16 mentees. You will divide up the mentees in half; each of you will have “your” mentees for 1:1 meetings at the start of the program (during Week 1, after the group session takes place) and at the close of the program (Week 6). During the program sessions, we encourage you to mix mentees up in different ways (not only with their primary mentor) so the cohort can connect. Co-mentors have the freedom to decide how to best do this. For example, you might decide initially in the first and second sessions to spend more time with “your” mentees as people are getting to know each other.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How will we be matched to a co-mentor?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Co-mentors will be matched based on a variety of factors, including your professional role at Microsoft, lived experiences, and comfort with different aspects of facilitation. While colleagues might naturally gravitate toward one another based on shared interests or experiences, this is not necessarily what promotes the complementary perspectives that can optimally support mentees. This means you may be stretched out of your comfort zone by your co-mentor match. Your participation in this program will be enhanced by the learning you gain from your co-mentor, beyond the work with your mentees.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What if I have time zone/schedule conflicts with my co-mentor?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You will be matched with someone who can do the same program time slot as you can. This is the same approach we used in the pilot programs, where mentors were able to successfully find a sync-up time. We are confident you will be able to find a way to coordinate, even if it is just before or after the program time slot.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How soon will we find out who our co-mentors are?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Your matching will be predicated on completion of the training, which includes all training sessions and self-guided assignments. All efforts to match you will be made, and we will be looking at logistical constraints (what program times you selected) to make sure your times match. We will announce the matches soon enough that you can prepare before the program start.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Do I need to schedule time each week with my co-mentor to prep before each training or is email sufficient for prep ahead of each training?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">That is really for you and your co-mentor to decide. Talk to each other about what will work for the other, and be willing to be flexible and meet the other person partway. Feedback from previous mentors suggested that coordinating with their co-mentor on the sessions was instrumental to their success.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Do you provide extra activities in case we do not have enough discussion to fill the program time?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">In the toolkit, there are some suggested topics that are related to each session. You can also brainstorm with your co-mentor and cohort to see if there are other ideas for what to discuss, perhaps something you have been working on or topics your mentees raised in their initial 1:1 meetings. While it is ok for the program sessions to end early, in the pilot sessions, mentors said mentees came with questions. You might need to afford a little quiet time to reflect, and even share suggestions through the chat, as the group gets to know each other. </p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Can I observe an actual live mentoring session in progress?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">The mentoring sessions with the mentees are not recorded so unfortunately this is not possible. We will be simulating some of the program activities in our training sessions and we hope this will give you enough of an idea of what you will be doing in your role as mentors.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">If I don’t feel very confident being a mentor, should I still participate?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">It’s perfectly natural to feel you may have more to learn as a mentor. By coming to training and fully engaging, we anticipate your comfort level will improve. There is time between the end of training and the launch of the program. This is intentional. First, the program organizers need time to finalize student recruiting and match mentors with campuses. Second, we need to provide you with time to look at the materials together with your co-mentor. You are entering a mentoring community of 150+ mentors who can field questions. Contact your program coordinator if you have further questions or concerns.</p>

          <h4 class="collapsible">When does the mentoring program start?</b></p>
          <p style="display:none">When you signed up, you indicated dates that you could commit to. Those dates are the precisely the dates for the mentoring program. Prior to the first date, you’ll be preparing with your co-mentor.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What should we do if a mentee misses a meeting?</b></p>
          <p style="display:none">That mentee will rejoin when they are able. You are not expected to help a student to catch up between program meetings. If you have capacity and want to, you can reach out to see if they need support or to offer to catch them up. Sometimes an email saying “We missed you at the last session and hope to see you at the next one” along with a reminder of the timing can be enough.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Will the mentees be located anywhere in the world rather than US specific? How do we coordinate timezones?</b></p>
          <p style="display:none">All mentors and mentees may be located anywhere in the world. The mentees, just like you, fill out a sign up form indicating the time slots they can commit to. For initial 1:1s, you can use the second hour of Week 1, as the group session is planned for only the first hour if that is convenient for you.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">If there's a way to practice creating and switching between breakout rooms or posting polls?</b></p>
          <p style="display:none">Please ask the program coordinator to sponsor such a session closer to your programs start date.</p>

          <h4 class="collapsible">Are there good ways to manage attention-fatigue especially when trying to be actively engaged for long periods of time?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Thank you for raising this. No one is perfect at active listening; it is something that grows with practice. One advantage of a co-mentoring partnership is you can work together. For example, you can ask your co-mentor, “did I miss anything?” or “what did you notice?”<br>
          <br>
          We certainly recognize and hear you on attention fatigue. During your own program sessions, please do feel you can offer a break halfway through or offer for people to turn off cameras for a little while. You will find what makes sense based on the energy and comfort of the group.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What is the best way to handle if none of the mentees want to share, even after the mentors have given their own thoughts? </h4>
          <div style="display:none">We practice inviting mentees to share and allowing them to pass. This is so important in a remote environment, where if you allowed only those with their hands up first to go, you’d tend to hear from the same people. You might also encourage quieter students to use the chat to share or to signal when they want to be called on. It’s ok to have some silence in the group. You can ask people to deliberately take a few minutes of quiet to think about what they heard, about the activity, or a recent class period at their university/college. This practice of breaking out into pairs/trios/small groups and coming back together also helps people warm up and share what they talked about with another person. Many activities are done in pairs/small groups; when mentees are asked to share, they are reporting back on what happened and what they discussed or did. In those cases, it is really rare that mentees would not share. This is a great thread for the Teams channel, and we also hope you ask the experienced mentors if this ever happened. 
          <ul>
            <li>Sometimes it can help to stay in the silence for a bit; it may be that people need some time to digest. You can note this as well (“We’ll try sitting in this silence for a minute. If you want, take the time to jot some thoughts down on paper or just reflect on what you might share.”)</li>
            <li>You can ask what the silence means: does it mean they want to change gears or perhaps it is difficult to share in the larger group? If the former, you can shift gears and move into another direction. You could encourage people to write in the chat some ideas or break people into pairs to generate ideas. If the latter, you and your co-mentor can divide up into smaller little groups with your own half of the mentees to talk about the topic in smaller groups.<br>
          </li>
            <li>It might be that the students will share through a different modality. Try inviting them to each type a response in the chat, but to NOT hit return. Wait a couple minutes (it’s usually clear from body language if cameras are in when they’re done), then ask them to hit return. Sometimes seeing everyone’s responses can help it to feel less like a weight is on a particular participant to share and will help to create more space.<br>
          </li>
            <li>You can try a group poll to gather more information (about the modality, topic, etc.)<br>
          </li>
            <li>Sometimes telling a random story or using an icebreaker can reset the interaction; if it’s something that makes you seem more approachable, it can help to lower communication barriers.<br>
          </li>
          </ul>
          Feel empowered to change it up if it is not working. You can always try something, see if it works and revise. (And you can name this for the group if you want to give them a heads up -- “We’re going to try something a little different now in the hopes that it can help us dig in a bit more.”)</div>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How might I recover from mistakes in speaking? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">Remember, you’ll get better with practice and experience. The more you keep facilitating, the more you will grow. This is part of why we offer training and a co-mentor model, so no one is navigating this process all by themselves. And every group dynamic is different and each session can be different. Show yourself some kindness if you make a misstep. There is no one way to recover from it. You can note it in the moment and that you are still learning. You can come back to it later if you find you couldn’t address it in the moment. Recognizing it can go a long way. And you can ask for feedback and support if you need it. Simply saying, “Hey co-mentor, I could use a little help with this part.”</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What's the best way to economize time and make sure everyone has an opportunity to participate?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">The opening video and CS challenge are all done in pairs and small groups. All mentees will get a chance to talk to a partner and other mentees. Be cognizant of who gets invited to report back on these activities for their pair or small group. That way in the closing round robin you can invite those who have not yet had a chance to share first. Remember there are multiple sessions; after the second session, even with 16 mentees, there should be a chance for every student to be invited to share out something even if in the first session it doesn’t turn out that way. Even if mentees do not get invited to share out, they will have actively participated.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">If students go into personal tangents in 1:1 sessions, what should the mentor do?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You will set the boundary as the session opens. It helps to say, “We only have a short check-in, so I hope to focus our conversation on learning more about how to support your participation in sessions (for example, learning how you communicate) and what interests you. If someone goes off track, it’s perfectly acceptable to steer them back. At the same time, if that is how the mentee wants to use the allocated time, there is no prescribed topic they *must* respond to. Everyone is different.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Will we have connections with the larger mentoring group when the program is running?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Some co-mentors post to the Teams channel if they have questions and/or want to share. This is entirely up to you. There are no required gatherings of the group during the program out of respect for your time obligation, which during the program is already 2+ hours per week (time for the sessions and sync-up time with your co-mentor).</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Is there a list of ground rules for co-mentoring to help with co-facilitation? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">While we do not wish to constrain your interactions with an explicit set of rules along these lines, you and your co-mentor could agree on some together. You’ll see that Week 0 of the Mentor Guide includes a “get to know you” session where you can talk about communication preferences. In addition, we did model the “time check” strategy and recommend at least discussing this as one possible way to signal the need to shift gears to one another. Many of you signed up indicating a goal of practicing/building collaboration skills, and you can reflect on the topics/strategies that came up in the videos (e.g., active listening, emotional intelligence) to guide you. If you feel something did not work well, please approach your co-mentor and see if it is possible to change up your approach to the next session; perhaps you can ask if you can try to lead a different component the next time. </p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How will round robin work with a co-mentor?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You and your co-mentor can decide what will work best for you. One option is to split up the different round-robins and assign one co-mentor to facilitate. That co-mentor can invite everyone to share, then synthesize and reflect back what they heard; they might then ask their co-mentor if they have anything to add. With a larger group, this might be better tag-teamed: one co-mentor asks the first half to weigh in before synthesizing and reflecting back, then the other co-mentor moves onto the second half. You can also consider a selective round robin, calling on people who have not yet had a turn in that session, then asking if anyone else wanted to share after they synthesized some things they heard. With the selection, be thoughtful of who you invite; it can sometimes lead to certain voices dominating the space.</p>
          <p style="display:none">There is no one way to facilitate a session. It is typical that co-mentors alternate and/or share the responsibilities in some way so both of their voices (and facilitation strengths) are part of the session.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How do we know if we are having an impact on the mentees?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">This is a great question. We do have a survey link you will share with mentees after the first program session and the last group session. These are collected by the program coordinator and this will give the program a view in aggregate about how the groups experienced the program. We hope this feedback and the feedback you provide to the program will help the program to improve. In terms of your own feedback seeking, we hope you will seek feedback from your co-mentor, informally from your cohort (e.g., asking if they want to see anything definitely discussed during the next session, asking for input on what is helping them to participate), from the Teams channel for this program, or from your program coordinator. Microsoft will be looking for feedback from both mentees and mentors to assess the impact.</p>

          <h4 class="collapsible">How commonly do we need to guide students away from thinking of us as tutors and towards thinking of us as mentors?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">While the mentees who sign up are advised that you are not tutors, and why we were deliberate to include activities that are very different than they will be seeing in their courses (e.g., none of our collaborative exercises include having mentees actually coding the solutions), it is always possible someone may ask you to stay on the call to help them with a course question. You should only answer questions you feel comfortable addressing. It’s perfectly acceptable to say, “While I’m willing to try to help you, I’d also like to strategize with you where you can get the best academic support possible. Since I am not at your institution or in this program of study, I do not want to steer you in the wrong direction.” If mentees are nervous to approach their peer tutors or instructors, you could help encourage mentees to be brave by engaging in role play or talking through their concerns.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What do I do if a mentee asks me to review their resume?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You are signing up as a mentor to help introductory students to advance in their tech journey. If a student asks you to review their resume, and you have time and want to, you can agree. If you do not wish to or do not have time, you can say, “Unfortunately that is out the scope of what I am able to do in this program. When the program ends, we could revisit this.” Or “Although I cannot help you with that, do you have someone at the campus career center who could help you? I’d be happy to brainstorm with you so you can get another set of eyes on that resume.”</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Are there some issues that cannot be kept confidential?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">There are some issues that cannot be kept confidential. In short, mentors are unable to keep conversations confidential that include when mentees threaten to harm someone else or themselves, disclose sexual assault, or share that they have observed faculty, staff, or students who may be putting others in danger (e.g., faculty who are showing up under the influence of drugs or alcohol in class). Specific examples such as these will be provided so that everyone understands that if these are disclosed you would need to elevate or report this to your Microsoft mentoring program coordinator. You might say: “Thank you so much for sharing that with me. This is something that rises above what I am permitted to keep confidential. I will need to share this with my Microsoft mentoring program coordinator. Within my role, what can I do to help you to move forward from here?”</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Are we allowed to email students between sessions?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">This is totally up to you! You can offer to follow up with a mentee via email or meet between sessions. We do not want you to feel obligated to do that if you do not have capacity. And we want to help you set boundaries around communication. Only offer what you feel comfortable doing and what you have capacity for. If you are able to do this, for the reasons you outlined, the mentee will absolutely appreciate it.</p>

      		<header><h2>Advice on story-sharing</h2></header>
                      
          <h4 class="collapsible">What if you feel like your stories are not good enough to share with mentees? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">Your stories are absolutely good enough! The goal is to share a little bit about yourself and get your mentees thinking about the topic. We ask that you do some reflection on the topics before the sessions so you can be intentional with your stories, and emphasize coping through struggles if/where relevant for you. No story is a “perfect” story. You’ll prep with your co-mentor for the mentoring sessions by looking at the topics; typically in each session, one mentor does the opening story-share if they feel they have a relevant story for that video, while the other mentor will typically do the closing story-share on the other video. The pilot mentors said this was one advantage of working with a co-mentor: being able to share the space and complement one another. Remember, you always have choices you can make with story selection, so you can bounce that decision off of your co-mentor as well.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Should the stories that we share be from our college days/internships, or is it fine to share experiences from our work experience?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">This is a great question. It is better to tell a story that you feel comfortable with and is vivid in your mind than to feel you must generate a story from your college days. There is no “correct” setting to draw your story from, but you’ll probably find that professional or academic settings feel more relatable than a personal moment. It is often a matter of making the connection (e.g., “although I am in a role where I review code of more junior colleagues, perhaps there is something that resonates with you as you think about starting your journey of learning CS”). And remember: you can ask your co-mentor for feedback on your story, and you can be strategic about choosing who will introduce which video/topic during a session.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">I graduated from college over 20 years ago, and so I don't have a good sense for the problems that college students face today. How do I connect?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You bring other dimensions to the conversation, and your perspective will be relevant and helpful for mentoring. Even if you do not know what students are going through (and often, we can’t know), you can bring an empathetic, supportive voice to the mentoring space. In our experience, what students are looking for is connection and investment: someone to listen to them, encourage them, and offer useful insights. As you reflect on the topics in the toolkit, you may find that your vantage point and journey into/through the tech industry can help remind students that there are steps along the way. If you are able to share that discussions from the training or those that unfold during your program have an impact on your own or others’ approach towards working with a team/projects, you’ll probably find the students to be both surprised and inspired to hear that learning and growth doesn’t have to stop when they graduate.<br>

          Keep in mind that you might be the only industry professional one student in the group has ever met personally (while others in the group may have many generations of college-going and/or tech experience in their families). At the same time, if you want to learn more about what college students are wondering about in today’s world, you do have access to some resources on-line. This piece highlights the impact of the pandemic on the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/print/quicktakes/2020/08/19/students-reporting-depression-and-anxiety-higher-rates">mental health</a> of college students. Experiences of <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/12/10/food-insecurity-among-students-continues-during-pandemic">food insecurity</a> among college students is also on the rise. From a technical perspective, there is a lot of variability in the nature of students’ introductory computer science courses, in terms of how large the classes are, the quality of feedback, and whether their learning includes any peer learning groups or sense of community. Please do ask the program coordinator, your co-mentor, or the Teams channel if you have specific questions as the program unfolds.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">When you invite us to intentionally construct our stories, does this potentially reduce the authenticity?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">This is a great question. We recommend three factors to consider when crafting your stories: (1) sharing when you struggled before succeeding, (2) being true or authentic to you, and (3) the impact for the mentee. There can be a tension here when balancing these factors. Sometimes it can be difficult to reconcile staying true to your story with the impact your story could have on college students just starting their tech journey.<br>
          <br>
          We recommend thinking intentionally about what story you want to share and how it could support a newer CS student as they navigate their pathway. There is no one way to tell or revise a story. Be true to yourself and to the students, and at the same time, be mindful of the impact you want to have on them. The goal of this program is to help students build their tech resilience. We hope to leave them with strategies to bounce back in the face of difficulty.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How does the group dynamic change when I'm the one that does not feel a sense of belonging? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">Thank you for sharing this. We know that working in the tech industry does not necessarily mean you feel you belong It is certainly not an expectation we have of you as mentors. Technical fields, workplaces more generally, and higher education all face the challenge of striving to live up to their promise to be more diverse and inclusive places. This program aims to foster a sense of belonging for mentees when they enter the mentoring space. Our hope is that co-mentors and their mentees can work together to create a space where folks feel they can bring themselves and be valued for who they are. We also hope you can keep in mind that a sense of belonging can be tied to situational and historical factors; even in a setting where people are making a conscious effort, we cannot expect this to automatically result in a space where everyone feels they are valued and respected.</p>
          <p style="display:none">We recognize that you as mentors come with your own trajectories and experiences; the tech field may not have created conditions that cultivated a strong sense of belonging for you. This can be a strength for you as a mentor if you choose to share pieces of your journey; your ability to persist can inspire your mentees and help those who do feel a stronger sense of belonging engage with the factors that are at play. We hope this program can help tech become a place where belonging is possible for all or at least take a step towards a larger understanding as to why it is not right now.</p>

          <h4 class="collapsible">What if a mentee shares they want to drop out of CS? Isn’t there a time when it’s best to advise them to do that? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">This is a great question. We hope that as mentors you always put it back to the mentee to make their own decision. Even if you think, by initially listening, the student may be better served by dropping the class, we want you to pause a minute and consider the following. Many introductory students, especially students from historically excluded groups, are encouraged to drop when they do poorly or when they do not appear to be a “fit” for the field. It’s of course possible that dropping is a good decision, but we hope to make sure a mentee first feels they *can* be successful before they make that decision and that they also know others may feel they don’t “fit in” in tech. When someone is learning a new area of study, it is common to feel lost and make mistakes. This is part of growing. If after they persist they decide to choose a different path, we hope that mentors will have been part of a process that led them to figure out how they could keep going if they wanted to do so.</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">What's the best way(s) to respond to mentees' stories, especially if they are serious and/or sad?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">You can thank a mentee for sharing their story. You also can reflect back that you heard that they are experiencing something very difficult, so they can know you heard them. Sometimes a person wants to be heard and does not want you to problem solve a solution. If you are concerned by something you hear, remember you have your Mentor Teams Channel (and you can share without naming the mentee) or reach out to your program coordinator to brainstorm.<br>
          </p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How do I handle a student that may not be interested and distracting to the group? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">We will suggest a few ideas, but remember that you can brainstorm with your co-mentor or the broader set of mentors on the Teams channel. Keep in mind that students will be coming from a variety of situations and sometimes external factors that they may not be ready to share can impact participation. Sometimes switching the modality of expected interaction can help -- this could mean using a poll, splitting up into smaller breakouts, using the chat to have everyone enter some thoughts before asking all to share, and so on.<br/><br/>
          Let’s say you see a few people on their phones or not engaged. Perhaps cameras are off; sometimes reminding students what a difference it makes to see their faces can switch a few cameras on. You can invite the engagement of the whole group by saying something like, “We’re really looking forward to all of you tuning in today. There are only a few more sessions, so let’s make the most of this time together. You may have a lot on your plates or be feeling tired, so let’s have everyone write in the chat whether you’d like to take a break in one hour to check messages and stretch.” The positive of this approach is everyone hears this message. The downside is that the student you are concerned about may not tune in, and others may feel you are avoiding direct communication (if it is obvious if it is one student who needs addressing). You can call in a mentee into the space; we find this tends to work better than assuming something negative (or publicly criticizing them). <br/><br/>
          Let’s say someone wants to pursue a tangent that is not really relevant to the topic for the day. For this, you might try a parking lot solution. “That’s an interesting question, X, and I wonder if we can put that in the parking lot to come back to during the open conversation time. [If we run out of time, I’d be happy to talk about that with you offline.]” At the end of the session, you can review the parking lot. If needed you can say, “X, I heard that you wanted to talk about ___, but we’ve run out of time. I’ll follow up with you on email/we can make sure to create space for this next week.” The last part is optional; you could alternatively suggest, “Perhaps you could look into that before the next session and report back.” </p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">How do I address inappropriate language during a session?</h4>
          <p style="display:none">Since there may be different assumptions for what language is appropriate, you might ask if people need anything else from the group in order to participate fully while reviewing the ground rules. If you observe language that is inappropriate, you can always tie this back to the ground rules in this way, “I’m hearing that this topic is bringing up a lot of emotion. Sometimes we express that using really strong language. I’m just noticing that we also want this space to be inclusive, so that means letting people express themselves how they choose and also being intentional as we think about impact on others.”</p>
          <h4 class="collapsible">Do you have any advice of things we should NEVER do? </h4>
          <p style="display:none">One of the self-guided assignment resources helps walk you through microaggressions. We want you to avoid singling out or stereotyping mentees based on their gender or race, for example. We ask that you uphold professional norms and expectations with your mentees as you are acting in a mentoring capacity. While these guidelines are helpful, we also want to encourage you to consider the affirming presence you can bring to the mentoring space by validating, encouraging, and inviting participation.</p>
